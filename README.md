This repository contains code to replicate the experiments in the ICWSM'17 paper entitled "Identifying Leading Indicators of Product Recalls from Online Reviews using Positive Unlabeled Learning and Domain Adaptation," by Shreesh Kumara Bhat and <a href="http://cs.iit.edu/~culotta/">Aron Culotta</a>. A full version of the paper is here: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00518>

The code was developed in a Jupyter Notebook running Python 3.4.3.

To get started, first install python dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, launch
`jupyter notebook Replication.ipynb`

You can then click `Cell->Run All` to reproduce all the figures and tables in the paper.
