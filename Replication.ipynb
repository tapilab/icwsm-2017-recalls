      "I purchased this product for my son, he was previously in a graco infant car seat which he couldnt stand being in.  The visibility is better in this one.  If I had known earlier, I would have started him in this convertible one.\n",
      "I'm sending this product back today!!! I thought the Recaro booster seat would be light weight and trendy.  This seat was so heavy I could hardly get it out of the box.\n",
      "I ordered this with great expectations. I would be able to work and surf without the pesky interruption of having to use the restroom. I got this via UPS and opened it up placed it on my toilet and grabbed my ipad and began to explore what I termed as surf brewing. I spent 8 hours on this little jewel on the very first day and was delighted, while in the middle of a conference call I simply placed my phone on mute so no one would hear my  explosion and remained on my webex while I absolutely blew the toilet up with no worries of anyone knowing the difference. After my call was over I wiped and logged out but when I tried to get up I realized my legs were completely numb and I fell flat on my face on the bathroom floor. What I soon realized was this seat was actually for a child and could not accomidate a grown mans package. My jewels had relaxed inside of the toilet seat and had somewhat swollen dues to me being on the throne for eight hours and were acting as a anchor and when I fell I took the ipad and potty seat to with floor with me, The ipad was shattered and the screen was in a thousand pieces and I had many cuts all over my hands and forehead and when I tried to get up the blood made me slip and bump my head on our tub rendering me unconscious for several hours. In the meantime my wife had arrived home and had tried to call me several times to see where I was to no avail, she assumed I was out on an errand and made herself a snack and sat down to catch up on the walking dead series. I awoke with a splitting headache an soon realized that the potty seat was rather snuggly around the boys as my fall had caused them to swell even more and I had bitten through my tongue during the fall as well. I tried to stand but the potty seat was making that totally impossible and the attempts to remove it brought blood curdling moans from deep within my manhood. I tried in vain to speak and realized my tongue was so swollen from having bitten it in my fall all I could get out were inaudible moans so I began to crawl through my office restroom out into our den attempting to moan my wife's name. Imagine my wife's horror when in the middle of a zombie attack on the show she was watching she looked over to see her husband covered in blood with a kiddie potty attached to his groin crawling across the floor to her moaning and grasping in her direction. She immediately ran out the door and over to our neighbors house where their teenage son was home. Rusty immediately grabbed his pellet rifle and rushed back over to our home and when he saw me trying to crawl back to the bathroom promptly shot me in the nuts from about 10 feet away. I screamed in agony as most of the feeling had begun to return to my roomates and legs and jumped to my feet shattering the torture device attached to my groin and lunged to exact my revenge on Rusty and his pellet rifle. Rusty promptly ran like hell and he and my wife called 911. I in the meantime picked myself up off the floor as I had fallen again during my lunge at Rusty due to my pants and underwear were still around my ankles. I got my pants up and went to the sink to get some water to wash myself off and while I was doing that 7 or 8 police cars showed up and I was told to come outside with my hands up. See when I fell the first time I had bruised my forehead so badly on the toilet my entire face had swollen so my wife had not ever recognized the zombie with a potty around his groin and had told the 911 dispatcher there was a stranger trying to have relations with one of the dog toys in her living room. unfortunately I could not speak as I had bitten my tongue during the fall so I could not alert the officers to my identity. I was taken to the station and after a few hours I was able to explain myself and get some medical attention and be released with icepacks on my head and my little friends. Other that that great product.\n",
      "So relieved they make this. I didn't want to use a bumper for fear of SIDS but my baby's arm and leg always got caught in the rails because he would end up sleeping next to the edge. This solved that problem, it's safe and it protects his little arms/legs from getting caught and also his head from hitting the side.\n",
      "From the Mattel Website:  Recall to InspectFisher-Price, in cooperation with the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, is voluntarily announcing a recall to inspect Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleepers(tm). Mold can develop between the removable seat cushion and the hard plastic frame of the sleeper when it remains wet/moist or is infrequently cleaned.A little common sense people!  Who lets their baby get SO WET that the whole seat cushion gets wet all the way down to the plastic frame??  Then you wonder why mold has developed?!?  Check your baby's diaper often, and wash the cushion from time to time and you shouldn't have a problem.We love our Snugabunny!\n",
      "Actually, the Baby Bjorn \"active\" carrier model was recalled in 2004 and the issue concerned the design of the buckle on the back straps and not the leg openings.  Apparently, the matter has since been resolved on this model which is now in stores/on-line.  Check Baby Bjorn's web site for further information...\n",
      "Would cut on by itself and then I would be stuck with nothing to heat my child's bottle. It was never warm enough for my baby either.\n",
      "We put our crib together last night a realized that there must be a specific size mattress for our crib.  I rushed to my computer to double check the dimensions of this mattress (which I purchased from amazon).  The dimensions listed here on amazon for this mattress are wrong.  I checked the tag on the mattress and it is 51 5/8 by 27 1/4 which is the exact size needed for our crib.\n",
      "Received my order today, but couldn't use it because over half the gate is broken!!!  3 of the 4 gate sections are broken!  My box was obviously an opened/returned product, because the bag of small parts was cut open on one end.  Very upset that I was sent a returned product with 3 out of 4 sections broken.Company was contacted about receiving a broken gate, and eventually did send a replacement.  but it took another two+ weeks to resolve the issue and get the replacement.\n",
      "My mother-in-law once told me how my husband loved the jumper that hangs by the door (40 years ago) and I already thought of putting one on my registry...except when I looked around the house, there was nowhere to put one... I searched in Amazon and found this product and got it. My son loved to stand and was able to hold his head up at 8 weeks old so I put the jumperoo together and put him in it. Well, his feet cannot thouch the ground so I placed a pillow there so he can stand up and because he was still tiny, I had to put a blanket at the back so he can reach the toys. He loved this the moment he tried it. The best memory was when he fell asleep on it. This gift made me purchase the whole rainforest collection and I was not disappointed.\n",
      "So, the adapter ring is key! I have not had a single leak with these bottles. They are BPA free and so easy to clean, even though there is an additional piece. (in comparison to the original Avent bottles) I only wih they would sell these with a faster flow nipple. Most babies who would require a 9oz bottle are probably using a faster flow nipple.\n",
      "minha filha come frutas com ele desde os 4 meses e adora e nao se afoga. facil de limpar e bem bonito\n",
      "The fridge works, but is a little noisy. Feels a little clunky when you close the door. Using it in the baby nursery and it fits four small bottles, but he tall bottle will not fit with the nipple and cover (fits only with a travel cover)\n",
      "Like many others, I have had this cup since my daughter started weaning from her bottle a year ago but stopped trying to use it after the first disassembly when I couldn't seem to get it back together so it wouldn't leak.  Feeling defeated, I stuck it in the back of the cupboard and forgot about it.My daughter recently found it and has been asking to use it so I did some new looking into this lid issue.  When I went on the foogo site, I discovered that the lid and valve mechanism has changed at some point and my model is no longer even pictured.  Mine has the hard blue shell, soft yellow spout, a hard plastic valve, and a silicone ring which I have never gotten to sit back in in any way that would let me screw the lid on tightly.  I decided to try it without the ring all together and so far it has worked with no leaks.  We will see how long it lasts.  Perhaps the \"newer\" version is less complicated and this has led to the discrepancy in reviews.\n",
      "I am really disappointed with the purchase of this product.  I couldn't use the suction ring because it didn't fit on my daughter's infant high chair tray and then to boot, the plate broke into pieces after it hit the floor!  I used the product for about 2 weeks total!\n",
      "It is effective, but it can be more difficult to use than some other options.Its use isn't intuitive - we had some workmen in our place for a few days and they just muscled the toilet lid up, breaking the adhesive (but not the device or the toilet). I know, they shouldn't have done this, but desperate times called for desperate measures...My wife also thinks its location on the rim near the front edge is \"icky\"Safety First has a model that mounts in the rear center top of the toilet lid and pushed against the tank - that one is much better.\n",
      "It holds our soothie pacifier. It has a better position for my newborn than the wabbanub and Mary Meyer brands.(I bought one of each brand) as it lays flat. They all stay with about the same.\n",
      "this is the dumbest infant toy ever!  mine was recd broke!  now I have to send it back which is a pain.  not worth more than $5\n",
      "The camera mount broke within minutes of being handled and I had to glue it together. The camera cannot be mounted upside down (ceiling beams, rafters, etc) so it took a little jimmying to get it into the right position. It can be a little difficult to see the screen in the dark. It also runs on the exact same frequency as my streaming devices (2.4gHz) and despite changing the channel on my router this thing absolutely kills the signal from my router. I only turn it on at night, so that solves that problem.\n",
      "This system does not work well. Our first attempt with swinging doors required them to be closed with enough force (but not too much) for the latch to catch. This would require way too loud bangs than what we are used to and wish. Most of the times the door would remain unlocked.We then tried using this on drawers and the same thing happened. The tolerances are too small for it to be easily installed. The latch moves on gravity and so it is too weak to catch and stay put. We abandoned this product and whilst the sticky portion is ruined, we will try to get a refund.\n",
      "I've been using Dr. Brown's Wideneck bottles for my now 9 month old for expressed milk when I couldn't be with her. My main complaint with those were the many pieces, but otherwise they were perfect. I thought I would give this alternative by Tommee Tippee a shot. In design, they are very similar.  These contain a tube that connects to a rubber ring which fit the opening of the bottle.  Then you fit the nipple into the plastic lid and then you have a cap. Lots of pieces but that's what makes the difference for sensitive tummies. The only improvement I found over Dr Brown's Wide Neck was that the tube has a color changing strip that turns pink when the milk is too hot.  Over all, this a great product but a great company!\n",
      "It's cheaply made. I washed it on the gentle cycle and it began to fall apart :(\n",
      "We had been using a fleece/velcro swaddle until our son was about 10 weeks, when we switched to a Miracle Blanket on a recommendation from a friend. Over the next week, he began to see breaking out of the blanket as a game. He'd wiggle from side-to-side to loosen the main piece of wrapped fabric, and thrust his upper torso up to gradually loosen his arms from the inner flaps to eventually break both arms free. This would repeat at least 3 times a night, and would result in him agitated and wide awake. After several weeks, his sleep habits worsened, I am convinced as a result of this blanket. We switched him back to the generic fleece/velcro swaddle and he has been sleeping much better. As before, he occasionally breaks an arm out, but falls right back to sleep.I think there are two design flaws with the Miracle Blanket: (1) there is no velcro or fastener to keep the wrap snug. After just a few wiggles, my infant was able to loosen it every time (and I am a tight swaddler). (2) I don't think the material is warm enough to keep an infant warm on colder nights.Based on other reviews, it sounds like others have had much more success than us. I just wanted to share my experience.\n",
      "4/24/12 Edit:My son is now 10 months old and still well within the weight limits but, the spring holding one of the sides to frame snapped. Their is no fixing it and it is pretty sharp also. I called fisher price today and they are refunding my original purchase price ($62.01). I have to pay return shipping on the post and the seat hold. I also have to find a box for it... ugh is all I can say that explains it right now. Maybe this will happen again maybe it won't. Buy at your own discretion.Original Review: (2/12)We purchased this toy when our son was 5 months old and started jumping well we were holding him. He loved it the first time we put him in it a 4 months later (9 months old) he still absolutely loves it. You can not go wrong with this purchase.Also I've read a lot of reviews with people reporting that their baby pinched his/her finger on the elephant. Although I have never yet had this happen to my son I feel (after experimenting with my finger near the elephant) that it more scares the children rather then hurts them.\n",
      "purchased this for the wife. it can only hold 4 oz bottles. my wife was pumping more than that at the height of her milk production. when we tried to use 9 oz bottles these supports did not hold.\n",
      "The headset area does not supply enough support for a childs head.  It kind of streches and the gives, so your sleeping childs head just falls off the side of the seat!  Swap for a Graco and am much happier.\n",
      "Easily put together. We have not attached it to the wall and it seems secure. So glad I looked online before buying from the store!!\n",
      "The dresser required assembly - some of the pieces were broken.  For what I paid it was very disappointing.\n",
      "The colored one is made of a much thinner fabric than the white ones.  Although the white ones also appear to be slightly thinner than the white ones that came with the blue set.\n",
      "My son was burning up and this thermometer told us his temp was 97.5, when taken rectally it was 103.7.  It's a terrible experience for us.\n",
      "These mat are easy to lay out and put away because they are light weight. They cover a generous area for your child to play on.\n",
      "My nine month old never slept well in a Pack-n-Play. We were going on vacation for two and a half weeks and I was worried about all of us sleeping. With this mattress he slept just as well as in his crib. It fit our Greco perfectly.\n",
      "We used these to attach a gate at the bottom of our stairs.  We installed this in January (when my son was 7 months old) and nearly 4+ months later the gate is still secure. My son likes to stand and shake the gate too!\n",
      "My son stands up in those wooden chairs at resturants so we bought this.  We use it as a booster in a booth seat or strap it to a chair for a highchair.  Wish I had had one 12 yrs. ago with my 1st child.\n",
      "Nice for portability.  Folds nicely.Don't know why the included a slip cover.  Thin....cheap.The tray is the worst piece for this product.  If the manufacturer would work on making it a little easier to get on/off this would be a 4 to 4.5 product.  Have to brace the chair against a wall to slide (push) it on.Saw a Fisher-Price for a few dollars more.not portable, but tray slides nicely.\n",
      "Bought this car seat for my 2.5 year old to give her more leg room to rear face longer. (NHSTA recommends until your child turns 4: [...]). She was complaining in her previous car seat about being \"stuck\". The Pria gives her plenty of leg room (she mostly sits \"criss cross..\") and she loves how it feels. It also gives her more of a view out of the car. It was relatively easy to install. The only issue we had was moving the LATCH strap from forward facing position to rear facing position. You have to undo the car seat cover and move the strap down (not in the manual). Once we figured it out, the install went well. The fabric feels like neoprene and there is plenty of cushion. She fell asleep in the car seat the first week, which she had not done in months. This is a good option for anyone looking to ERF.\n",
      "My baby has a mild case of torticollis (tight neck muscle) and prefers to hold her head to the right.  By the time she was a month old, I noticed that the right side of her head was developing a flat spot.I saw this product on Amazon, and ordered one right away.  We use it during naps (supervised), when she is on her play mat, etc.  Until she was about 3 months old, this prevented her from turning her head to the side.  With the combination of some stretching exercises that her pediatrician showed us, the torticollis has greatly improved and the shape of her head is almost perfect now.I initially used this at night time in the crib.  I then realized that it was a possible SIDS risk, because of the cushioning of the product.  We now only use it during the day time.\n",
      "My 3 1/2 month old has been attached to his monkey since he was about 3 weeks old. He doesnt need/use the pacifier for longer than a few minutes, but his face lights up when he sees his monkey. When he started day care I made sure it went with him so that he would having something familiar and comforting with him during the day. It has defintely helped him develop his dexterity and can easily reach for/handle the monkey.\n",
      "I purchased these a month ago and the fabric is separating from the elastic.  I have washed these 4 times and it should not have frayed apart already.  Quality is not there.\n",
      "This diaper is so cute. However even though it fit on my 7.5 lbs 6 week old daughter, she did not like it and I could see why! With the inserts there is no wiggle room between baby's flesh and the cloth. It is just smashed against baby's bottom and I had already witnessed what happens when baby poops in a diaper that is too constrictive, blow out! So I immediately took it off. Just to give a better picture of the diapers poor design, the leg holes did not fit the legs snugly all the way around. Like the absorbent cloth inside lifted the cover so much that it stretched the leg holes. I have a very slender baby too, so I was shocked as she does not have a very well endowed bottom either. Diaper is super cute though if you're lucky enough to have it fit your little one!\n",
      "Very soft. I am using mine on a co sleeper, mini crib (arms reach).  It is a little loose but I am able to make it work safely.\n",
      "My 7 month old moves his head around a lot (start of ADD?) and so he needs a wider bib near his neck.  This item is way to small right under the chin/ neck area but I hope he grows into it as they are super cute and look like low maintenance.\n",
      "I have no idea how some reviewers have had the experience of this item breaking or chipping. My son has been chowing down on it since he was 3 months old and it is still unchipped (paint and wood). Haba has very high quality products, because unlike the US the Eu has very strict guidelines on what the children's toys and items should be like. I think that maybe it was bad luck for these reviewers.It is a clip and a toy as well. My son is now 10 months old and he still plays with it.\n",
      "Am I really the only one who received a pair that didn't fit easily into the connectors? I struggle to connect and disconnect these whenever I pump... Kind of annoying.\n",
      "Works nicely. I bought two, one for the pack -n- play at home, and one for the car seat. I usually attach the paci to a clip, clip it to the fabric on the arch over the pack -n- play or one of the straps on the car seat, then place the paci itself in the little pocket to keep it near to my daughter and easy to pull out with the strap on the clip.  But the pocket minimizes exposure of the part she sucks on to the environment. I like it. Works for me.\n",
      "I had such high hopes for this, as it seemed to combine a bunch of corresponding needs: acclimating my son to using a backpack before pre-school, ditching the bulky diaper bag, encouraging him to take care of this things, and keeping him in a child protection safety harness (aka kiddie leash, a cute plush version of which he's been wearing since he started walking.) I read & re-read the description for this backpack three times before purchasing it, and even took out my ruler to get a better idea of its size - my son is a VERY small 2.5 year-old, so even though the specs were small, I figured it would work for him.It *does* work, but man is it disappointing. The backpack is tiny, and can't hold more than a diaper, small pack of wipes, and a book, which leaves me shlepping around the snacks & other toys I need to bring for Bubs when we're out. The mesh pocket on the side can barely fit a slender sippy cup, and even once its successfully crammed in, there's no guarantee it won't pop out at the slightest touch. The harness strap sits VERY high up on his chest & doesn't adjust easily, while the shoulder straps loosen too easily! The lead is very short, and while so are we, there isn't a lot of slack to it; additionally, it sits very low at the base of the backpack, and if jerked, folds the wearer in half (which does not happen with a dual harness across the chest & above the waist.)The Skip Hop Zoo line is adorable, and I would upgrade to their regular child's backpack, but that would be *too* big for my little guy to wear. If any of their R&D; staff happens upon this review, please, make a backpack sized between these two options WITH a harness, or at least chest strap, as the current design for this model leaves a lot to be desired.\n",
      "The strap comes locked in place I had to pry it open to adjust it and it broke if it wasn't for crazy glue this would be in the trash!\n",
      "We have b/g twins who just turned 2 and are turning into little climbing monkeys.  We have 2 of these gates, installed at the same time.  One gate has held up much better than the other, but the one that hasn't held up great is admittedly in the highest traffic doorway in our home.  It works well, but the locking mechanism broke after about one year.  Now we keep a bungee strap on it to keep it closed.  Overall happy with the operation of this gate...it can be operated with one hand by a person with average dexterity, and as of yet cannot be operated by the twins!  We have 5 safety gates in our home, possibly more to come as the twins are figuring out how to climb out of their cribs!  ACK!\n",
      "I was extremely dissapointed with these baskets. The basket is very cheap looking and one of the baskets in my set was unevenly woven.  The lining is very thin and cheap.  All of the liners had loose thread, and one liner was dirty with brown stains.  I am definately going to try and return.\n",
      "We bought this stroller for our new born, and have been using it for 2 months and half.  The zipper of the canopy already broke after few uses.  The stroller is not easy to fold and open - certainly not a one handed job as it advertised.  Also, don't expect to fold it flat and compactly - it's a big stroller and it's not light as you may think.  Drink holder is very small, only holds bottle water, you can't put your ice coffee cup in there.  However, it is a well balanced stroller.\n",
      "Started making Sushi for my hubby. Now he can take it to work without worrying if i am trying to poison him with by giving him spoiled sushi. This ice mat fits perfectly in his sushi cooler bag and keeps it poison free.\n",
      "I purchased one of these when my first child was born-- he is now 5.  It stood up until he outgrew it, at around 3 1/2 years.  We live in the city, and our strollers take a beating-- constant daily use, literally miles per day.  This stroller did well.When my daughter was born (she is now 2 1/2) we purchased a second new Quest for her.  This one has not stood up.  It is amazing what changes in a few years!  The wheels didn't wear evenly-- one of the back wheels took all of the weight, and after about 1 year was completely worn through.  It cost $40 at the Maclaren retail store to have back replacement wheels put on (this was never needed with the first stroller!).... Well, today wheel set number #2 completely failed.  Returning from daycare I noticed one of the two back left wheels was missing...WTF???? We limped on the remaining wheel through our day and to the baby store to buy a replacement stroller-- highly annoyed at having to purchase a second stroller for 1 child, but I'm not going to pay another $40 to fix something that obviously is mechanically flawed.  Needless to say, the stroller purchased today was not a Maclaren.\n",
      "It's fine. It's simple. And the freaking armrest pads constantly fall off and get kicked out of the car while the child hops out for school while you're in line with a hundred other cars behind you waiting to drop off their kids while the helper-outer-teacher picks your armrest cover off the ground and tosses it back into your car for the third time that week. But, whatever, it's a cheap little seat.\n",
      "I'm a first time mom and decided to get this pump because it's moderately priced and Medela is a good name.  I've had it for almost 6 months and it has lost suction completely.  During these 6 months, I've used it less than 10 times in the first 3 months (while I was still on maternity leave), twice a day for the first month I went back to work, and once a day since then.  It was great how efficient this pump was; it only took about 10 to 15 minutes for me to pump both sides.  However, for the past 3 weeks or so I've noticed that the suction level had gone down dramtically; (when I would only pump one side) I was leaking faster than it was pumping!  This morning I wanted to pump before work and there was no suction at all.  I've checked the tubes, the bottles, the valves, everything, and there was nothing wrong with any of them.  I'm very disappointed in this Medela pump.\n",
      "The video is very nice but I cannot access the internet on my computer or iPhone when it is turned on. As soon as I turn off the camera, my internet comes up immediately. I am not sure if it has to do with my internet carrier (Verizon FIOS) or the camera's WIFI. Just be weary of this possibility. Also wish it came with a mounting bracket for the wall, it is a little bit of a pain having it sit on the dresser as that kind of defeats the purpose of trying to get a good angle on the whole room. It does give you a website that you can send away for a bracket but who wants to do that.\n",
      "The locking mechanism on this bassinet does not work. Even when it is set to \"lock\" the bassinet can tilt with the slightest movement, even just when the baby moves. This causes the baby to roll to the side and puts baby's face too close to comfort with the padded sides. It looks nice and I like the light/music/vibration feature, but none of this matters when the bassinet is a SIDS risk. Also, the box for the vibration itself can tip the bassinet to one side.\n",
      "Finally! How taking your temperature is supposed to be!!Took me a few times to find the correct angle and depth, but wow.  When you pull the trigger on this thing, it doesn't mess around.  Fast and accurate.  Found it interesting that the eardrum shares blood supply with the part of the brain that is supposed to regulate body temp, so it makes sense that the most accurate readings possible are in the ear.I can't believe my good fortune at being able to stay hydrated with cool fluids and still check temperature just whenever.  I can be sucking down iced tea and take my temperature between chugs.This kind of thermometer is worth it's weight in gold when you don't feel good.\n",
      "My daughter is an escape artist when it comes to bedtime and naptime. From the time she was a week old, she would manage to get at least one arm free from her miracle blanket or her swaddling blankets. She wouldn't sleep unless she was held or had her arms and legs tightly wrapped so we switched her to a woombie and now she is 5 months old and still can't figure her way out! As soon as we started putting her in the wrap, she started sleeping longer and longer at night. At 6 weeks, she slept 6 hours straight. By 2 months, 8 hours and by 4 1/2 months, 11 hours at night! We now only use it at bedtime because we are trying to ween her from needing it at all but it definately helped a ton during those early months so I had to buy this for a friend!\n",
      "I am the proud mama of a fussy 5-week-old boy...he's not colicky, but he wakes up fussy, cries after a feeding, and resists falling asleep.  It usually takes about 40 minutes after a feeding to get him to fall asleep, and he only falls asleep if he's being held and rocked--and when I try to put him down after he's asleep, he wakes up and the whole process restarts.  That's why he's ended up sleeping on or next to me every night since we came home from the hospital...and even so, he was only sleeping for about an hour or two at a time. He just wasn;t able to calm himself back down if he woke up--I had to hold and rock him.I thought he didn't like being swaddled...but after trying out the Miracle Blanket last night, now I realize I was just a bad swaddler!  When I try to swaddle him with a regular blanket, he inevitably frees his arms within minutes, and keeping his arms calm is the key...last night, the first night using the blanket, he slept for four hours between each feeding--in his bassinet!  And it only took him about 5-10 minutes to fall asleep after each feeding...I held and burped him like usual, then he dozed off and I could actually put him down without him waking back up!  Even when he did wake back up, he was able to calm right back down.  He didn't cry one single time.  Fabulous!!!The only reason I say it's not quite a miracle is that a true miracle would be sleeping 7 or 8 hours straight...but hey, he's only 5 weeks old, so I'm definitely happy with the results we got.  If you're strung out on endless 30-minute naps like I was, it's certainly worth a shot!\n",
      "Spring broke on BOTH of my Mommy Hooks after 3 shopping trips.  The spring is not weight bearing at all, just used to open and close the hook.  Heading to Home Depot to get the boat hooks we've used on our boat.  Priced cheaper with better quality too!\n",
      "I like Maxboost cases. These cases are high quality at an affordable price. If you want to change your case often, and not break the bank then Maxboost is the company for you. It's so easy to put on your phone. Just snap it on, and go. Happily it's not hard to take off, but on the other hand it doesn't just fall off like other cases on market. It's a quality product, and well be a return customer. My brothers, and I are very hard on our tech products, and often our cases look awful. This cases hasn't got scratches on it, and it's protecting the phone.\n",
      "Works very well with the Skip Hop straw bottles and it comes with a handy straw cleaner\n",
      "This head massager will give you headaches and it easily broke. One of the set arrived broken. But fine since I have 2 more extra. But with the price, it just not worth my time & hassle. Lesson learn: you get what you paid for.\n",
      "We have been using this swaddle blanket with our daughter since she was 2 months old and she is now 3 months old. Based on the size I anticipate being able to use it with her as an effective swaddle blanket until she is about 6 or 7 months old, maybe longer, depending on how fast she grows. It is a nice solid material. The fabric is not quite as stretchy as the first swaddle blankets we used when she was a newborn, but the fabric is nicely stretchy and the size is great for her now that she is bigger and still wants to be swaddled each night.\n",
      "Came across this after buying the Britax B Safe car seat.  I thought I would have to buy a whole new stroller for the car seat, but did some research and found this allowing me to attach the seat to the City Mini I already have.  I received it quickly and it is so easy to use!\n",
      "****UPDATE:**** I have now been using this highchair with my 1 year old son for about six months and these are my thoughts so far:First off, I purchased it in \"cranberry\" and although it looks pink in some photos, it is actually more red than pink. Definitely okay to use with boys.There are very few cracks and crevices for food to get stuck in and cleaning it has been a breeze. It looks gorgeous and modern and we have really loved it so far.There are definitely a few flaws that Phil&Teds; will hopefully address in a future model. Many users complain that it is difficult to get the tray on and off and we have found that is is much easier for us to leave the tray on at all times and simply slip him in and out. (He's 25 pounds, not sure how long this technique will work for, especially as his legs get longer)I have not installed the full \"5 point harness\" as it is pretty much useless. We buckle him in some times but most of the time, I only use the chair while we are eating, and do not leave him unsupervised.The legs are wide and flimsy, easy to trip over but hasn't been a major problem for us thus far.Overall, I am happy with my purchase and think the design is very pretty.\n",
      "It is important you know before you spend all your money on this monitor.The monitors are NOT interchangeable.ALL the monitors MUST be plugged in. The infant monitor MUST stay plugged in at all time. The parent monitors will make an absolutely horrid, obnoxious beeping sound even if fully charged while they are unplugged. The beep is actually louder then an infant screaming with all of their might. It's absolutely ridiculous!!!The night-light is a nice feature, that is, if the monitors were actually portable, which they really are NOT, unless you want to listen to it scream that it is unplugged and/or you want it to wake your child.It works on the basics, nothing more.\n",
      "I've used Avent manual for 4 years of nursing and a LC gave me one of these for free and its terrible.  It will barely take milk out while the Avent completely empties me out.  It also looses latch constantly since the suction is so weak.\n",
      "This is a great bed rail!  We had another one and on the first night he fell out - but has never fallen out using this one.  And this child loves to lean on it asleep and awake (no matter how many times we tell him not to)!  It did take a little longer setting up, but it was just myself doing it...\n",
      "I like this stoller due to the sharp color that attracts me. This will be a very fit stroller to my son's personality.\n",
      "After about the 50th time that my toddler turned off the computer in the middle of paying bills or anything else important, we were on the hunt for what we could do to cover up the power button.  This guard is wonderful! Not only does it stay on snug so she can not turn the power off it is also thick enough so that the blue glowing light disappears.\n",
      "Those absolutely gorgeous. I have purchased 4 of light pink Pom poms for my baby's nursery. And today I am getting 2 more of bright pink poms. They are made from expensive kind of tulle, buy them you will be glad you did!\n",
      "They are the worst bottles I have ever purchase !!! Everytime we feed him it leak all over him and made my baby cry so hard because it make so much gas.You will never know how much he drinks. because he keeps on spits back out.I have purchase all the bottles in the market so far the Playtex vent aire is the best^__^ no leak, no gas, no colic.\n",
      "I got this as I need a safe infant option to use that saved space as I have a toddler and I did not have room to store infant tub in the same bathroom. This was a good solution but I wish it was a bit heavier. When I move the baby to readjust her position, the hammock moves because it is floating in the water. It is a little difficult to negotiate bathing my intact alone with this.\n",
      "This play yard if great from infancy on. The bassinet makes a good place for the tiny one when you are away from her main bassinet. The changer is also a great help when away from the main changer in the bedroom. The play yard is a safe place for baby when you need to put her down.\n",
      "When I was pregnant I did no research on bottles or formula because I was going to exclusively breastfeed my baby and I was going to be a stay at home mom. However, I had some hormonal issues that made it impossible to do so and it quickly became apparent I had to supplement my baby with formula. I had Medela bottles only, the ones that worked with the Medela pump. So, that's what I was using. My baby would take about one hour to finish his milk on the Medela bottles and often fell asleep before he was done with the correct portion of milk. I figured I should get new bottles and my sister had used the AVENT.So, I got the AVENT bottles. It worked like a charm. He took his milk in half the time and often I would top him off with breastfeeding with absolutely no problem of nipple confusion. These bottles have never leaked for me, so I am baffled as to why so many reviews call them leaky. I have not tried Dr. Brown's bottles because they look complicated. Some of the AVENT bottles come with an extra attachment for the top of the bottle. I figured out how to use the attachment in like 2 seconds. The advanced don't have that extra part, so they are a bit simpler. Nipples come off easily for cleaning. The material also looks quite durable, although you don't use the nipples for long. They have the 0+ month nipples, the 3+ month nipples, and 6+month nipples. The other thing I like about these bottles is that you can buy the variable flow nipples for the baby is ready for cereal in his milk or if your baby has GERD and needs the cereal early. All you do is turn the bottle to increase or decrease the flow (read the variable flow nipple insert).\n",
      "This monitor does it all!  The swivel head on the camera is so useful for when my baby is sleeping but moving all over the crib.  And it doesn't make a sound as it moves, so baby doesn't wake up!  Well worth the money spent!  We use it within a short distance so I can't comment on it's distance.\n",
      "I can not wait to have strangers call my 7 mo old a 'Douche' Bag while strolling in Central Park.\n",
      "I don't have a problem with the bottle at all... but the nipple is terrible.  It's flat and awkward and my 9-week old baby would give me a very strange look whenever I tried to feed him with it.  Plus after only one use, the nipple broke!  I got my money back, but I'll never get back the 10 minutes of my life I spent buying and returning these pieces of junk!!!!\n",
      "I don't believe in warming bottles in the microwave and use glass bottles for my daughter. Prior to purchasing, I was boiling water and submerging the milk. With Kiinde Kozii, the indirect heating doesn't scorch the milk and heats it just right. I like the ease of use, and it's easy to clean. You'll have to play around with the timer to test how warm you want your milk/food.\n",
      "This is about 3 inches wide and 4 inches long, it is tiny. Works well and small hands an work the small vehiclesI would buy it again.\n",
      "We brought this monitor home and it didnt work the second we had it in the house.  There was so much static and it cut out.  I threw it away because my dad bought us a good monitor with a temperature and humidity reading and it works well.\n",
      "I bought this for a baby shower gift.  I put it together myself in under 20 minutes.  It is sturdy and looks very nice.  It did not come with any defects and did not have any weird \"chemical smell\" as other reviewers stated.  The only thing I didn't like was that the pad was junk, buying your own is a must... that's the reason for the 4, not 5, stars.  Even if you thought the pad was sufficient, the covers that they sell in the store will NOT fit this pad.\n",
      "My daughter is very adventurous and loves new things but not this she is not. Comfortable walking without holding on to something and she screams when I put it on her\n",

      "I was so excited to get this necklace and my daughter likes it, however it's next to impossible to wear with my shoulder length hair. The rubber stones pull and pinch at any strand they touch and its incredibly painful. It's a super cute necklace and if I had super short hair I'd probably rate it a 5. My daughter does seem to like the pendant necklace better anyway though.\n",
      "My 3 week old grandson quiets down when we put him on the Baby Einstein Discover the World Play Gym. He quiets down so much... that his parents have dubbed this baby play gym, \"The Magic Mat.\" They love it; he loves it; it's a win win situation. The music grabs his attention & the adults like it, too. The Light-Up Musical Globe is removable and can be fastened to a stroller or crib, etc., use your imagination...it can be taken with you. The globe can also be set for motion detection which helps save batteries.When he gets tummy time on the mat, the colors keep his interest. He's too young to focus on much right now, but has been checking out the panda, too. When he's on his back, waving his arms around, he's moved some of the hanging toys; it won't be long before he'll deliberately reach for them.I was surprised how easy this mat is to fold and put away. Because of its design, all that needs to be done is to bring up a side and carry it away. Very quick, easy to be put away, easy to set back up. It doesn't take up much room when it's folded and could be stored right next to end of your couch, behind a chair, etc.The Light-Up, Musical Globe takes 3 AA batteries..not included.This has proven to be a great purchase for our grandson!\n",
      "Bought this for my granddaughter and we all love it!  The colors on the fabric are bright.  The top of the activity bar has several settings so you can turn music on or off, move through the music choices, and set the little mobile to turn.  On the underside of the top piece are little \"creatures\" (a butterfly, etc) that light up to the rhythm of the music.  All of the hanging toys are interchangeable, so you can move them from one spot to another.  In fact the top mobile can be detached and hung from a car seat, carrier, or stroller.  My granddaughter enjoys the sounds and lights.  She was just shy of 1 month old when we put her on it for the first time.Easily folds up to move or store.  Excellent product!!  A little pricey compared to others, but well worth the money.\n",
      "Our 3rd (and final) daughter had a hard time settling down for naps.  We purchased this at the suggestion of many from church. We are so glad we did. It settles her down almost instantly. Plus the sounds are excellent for soothing sleep.\n",
      "I ordered this fitted sheet to match the bedding I currently have; however, when the package was received it was not the same sheet in the picture.  I received a polka-dotted sheet verses the butterfly and flower sheet that is shown.\n",
      "We used these in our last place, and they worked great.  Stuck on the door easily with double-sided tape, stayed put, and were easy to use.  However, in our new place, the doors are too widely spaced, and just slide right over it.  I've heard there's a spacer you can get to solve that problem, but I've yet to find it.\n",
      "I have an 18 month old daughter that did not start using a pacifier until we moved her from a bottle to a sippy cup. We tried several different brands to help soothe het at nap time and bedtime and this brand is by far the best! They come in great bright colors and even have some that glow in the dark in case the pacifier gets lost by baby in the middle of the night. The pacifiers also come in these great little cases that hold 2 pacifiers which are great for throwing in a diaper bag or purse. The cases are microwaveable so you can sanitize the pacifiers in them too! This is a great product!\n",
      "I really wanted to like these bibs because the designs are so cute but they were damaged the first time I washed them. The instructions on the website are to machine wash and dry, but when I ran them through the dryer the waterproof coating became cloudy and cracked. We later bought the superbibs and love them.\n",
      "2011 update (one year later): We have been using this stroller practically every day now for the past year to take the kids and the dogs out on walks around the neighborhood and I am still very pleased with my purchase.  We keep this in the garage when not in use and it is still looking like new.  We only load it into the car when we are expecting to do a lot of walking and it is a little cumbersome to get it onto the back of the minivan.  I guess my only other issue with this stroller is that the seat backs are pretty deep, so the kids have to lean forward sometime if they want to see out of the sides. However, I still love the near-flat recline feature of the seats since I use it to change diapers on my youngest child when we are on the go like at the zoo or amusement park.  Overall, I continue to highly recommend this stroller!2010 original Review: I can't say enough good things about this stroller!  When I was first in the market for a double stroller I considered getting this stroller because I have the single City Elite stroller and that thing is amazing: wonderful all terrain ability while it steers like a dream, but I balked at the price of $500+ for the double...needless to say, after going through 3 other strollers I finally got the City Elite double and I am so thrilled to finally find something that meets all my needs and looks stylish too.Here is some background on the previous strollers I tried: First stroller: Maclaren Twin Triumph-solid but narrow seats and I could never get the hang of how to fold the darn thing; Second stroller: Baby Jogger single with the jump seat attachment: worked great when my youngest was an infant, didn't work so great after 4 months of age when he started being able to constantly kick the back of the jump seat thus annoying his sister; Third stroller: Chicco Cortina Together Double: wonderful storage basket but the rear seat belt is so narrow, I am unable to buckle my 2 year or my 6 month old and the canopies are cheap, flimsy, and continuosly pop-off, very dissapointing for a Chicco product!I also came very close to getting a Bob Revolution Dualie, because of all the great reviews, but when I put my 6 month old in a floor model at the baby store, the seat belt was already tight on him at the loosest setting!I was specifically looking for a stroller that I could take on walks around the neighborhood that would include uneven side-walks, gravel, grass, etc, while providing a smooth, shock-absorbing ride for the kids and wouldn't require a herculean effort to get it over a simple curb on my part.  However, if you are looking for an even lighter stroller to use on even terrain such as airports or malls, I would consider the Baby Jogger City Mini Double, I test drove that stroller and it was so light and zippy, but definitely not made for all terrain.  The City Elite Double stroller has everything I was looking for...all terrain capability, adjustable large canopies with two peek-a-boo windows; side and rear ventilation, almost flat recline, adjustable handle bar; parent console; a kicker for younger riders, and best of all, it offers PLENTY of room width and height-wise for the kids.  Also, you CANNOT beat Baby Jogger's single-step folding technology, it is just amazing!  This was also the easiest stroller I have ever assembled, just unfold the stroller, pop in the four wheels and you are ready to go! The 2010 model is different from the 2008 single version in that the brake is now hand-operated and the tires are foam so they don't need to be pumped with air.There are a few drawbacks to this stroller, which include the hefty price tag and the weight.  However, I would have saved more money had I purchased the City Elite Double straight-away instead of buying less expensive strollers.  Also, for the money that you pay, you get premium quality features that make the stroller a joy to use and a super comfortable ride for the kids.  As for the weight, all double strollers are heavy, I find this less cumbersome to fold  and lift than the Maclaren umbrella stroller.  Again, I cannot recommend this stroller enough, especially for parents of larger babies/kids who want a stroller that will offer plenty of room.\n",
      "We purchased these right before a move.  At our old place, the doorknobs had a flat face (? don't know how best to describe it) they did NOT work well on those doorknobs.  It was very difficult to get a good grip using the buttons.  I had to use two hands to make it work!  At our new place the doorknobs are round and the covers work beautifully.  Just make sure your doorknobs are round\n",
      "I wasn't sure about ordering Alva Baby diapers because some people had told me that they were cheaply made. Maybe that's true, but I haven't been able to tell the difference between these and my whopping $20 a pop BumGenius new diapers. I absolutely love the suede cloth. I have washed this diaper so many times and it has stayed just as soft as when I first purchased it.It's not too bulky for daytime use, but it also works really well with night time use for my almost 3 year old. The diaper itself is a little big--- this would not fit my 13 week old. The legs are still a little too big from him, but I purchased it FOR my toddler, so I got out of it what I intended.Overall, a great value for my money!\n",
      "When I had my first child a friend gave me her older Medela pump in style. I know they say not to share, but I bought new shields, valves, hoses, etc. It used to have a suction dial and a separate speed dial, but it did not have the special let-down button. I loved this older model, I felt it was much more powerful and I usually had it to 80% power. After it broke I decided to buy a newer model before the birth of my second child. I was really disappointed with their \"improvements\". There is only one dial that controls suction and speed together. I find this is much less effective. I frequently have it all the way to full power and I wish it could go higher so I could pump in less time. For the record, I have a fast let-down and a very good supply and I still find it isn't powerful enough for me. I find that the bag interior is so much smaller than the previous model and when you pack shields, hoses, power cords, bottles, and more, the more space the better. I also wish that the pump motor could be removed, similar to the freestyle model so you could put it in any bag you wish. Also, the let-down button is nice but definately not necessary. You could get similar results starting out at a lower speed. I wish often that Medela would offer the old model again or at least stop discouraging people to share or re-sell their older pumps. Why do breastpumps have to be single-user when you have to get completely new accessories anyway?\n",
      "I love having my little one drink from glass and these sleeves are great in the washer (some of the other brands trap water in the bottom).\n",
      "This chair is great.  Easy to assemble and disassemble.  Nice little pocket in the back for storage.  Easy to wipe down.  It didn't fit our dinner table so we just it at the kitchen bar area and she watches us cook.\n",
      "I hate polyester, and any synthetic fabric. I'm glad I found this soft sleep sack. It's a very good quality product. However, I agree with the reviewer who says that it won't keep the baby very warm. My baby likes to sleep in lower temperatures, and he is always warm. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to use this.\n",
      "This car set base is great for the grandparents car or a necessary 2nd vehicle in which a child will be traveling.  I only wish that one day, they make a rotating base to ease up on our bodies when putting the car seat into the base.  Construction of the items is great.  It anchors into newer vehicles with a little bit of a fight but no big deal.  Very pleased.\n",
      "The FuzziBunz one sized diapers are a bit smaller than the medium FuzziBunz. I'm not sure how they'd fit a truly large sized baby. I like the replaceable elastic and the snaps but my daughter is currently in a medium FuzziBunz and I am sure she will outgrow this one size fits all diaper when she outgrows her mediums. If you think you need a large FuzziBunz order a large. We use them for overnight with several liners (3) in the pocket and I think a large would have been the better choice for us.\n",
      "Very impressed with product.  6 month old is just learning to sit on his own and I don't worry about his tumbles or falls on this soft foam.\n",
      "I researched a LOT of gates before buying this one through Amazon and can tell you that it is a very good looking and solidly built gate that is easy to install and use and you won't find it for any lower price anywhere else, and Amazon gives you free shipping!  I use this gate to separate dogs that I dog sit and have had no problems, even with 100# dogs.  Some other reviewers say that it is narrow; I am 300 pounds at 6 feet tall, needless to say I am not a skinny person (wink) and I have no problems getting through this gate including the 2\" bottom rail which is necessary for the structural integrity of the gate.It is so easy to install I contacted the manufacturer and ordered a spare set of mounting hardware so that I can use the gate in two parts of the house (I chose to use the permanent mounting cups as they afford much more stability).  And when using the included extensions it is just as stable as without.The gate's finish is a dark bronze which I think is VERY nice, not black as stated by others, and I think will fit into most decors (it is much nicer than anything I found at the local pet stores).In all, I have nothing bad to say about this gate; if you are looking for a gate that fits within the specified dimensions of this gate, buy it!\n",
      "Great size for storing purred baby food, however the containers don't stay closed. I have to tape them shut, otherwise they pop open and the food dries out or goes bad.\n",
      "This sleeping mat (and pillow) can be folded and wrapped up like a sleeping bag.  The end can then be fastened with the Velcro straps and there is an attached fabric carrying handle and a \"This belongs to: ________\" tag so you can write your child's name on the blanket.It's cute but the giraffe print material on the stuffed animal and on the front of the blanket is 100% plush polyester and feels like cheap material.  If you run your hand across this material in the opposite direction of the fabric grain, you get this dull, fuzzy, pilled appearance that makes the blanket look like it was washed too frequently.  The pillow is also very flat and if your child sleeps on the pillow, expect them to wake up with a sweaty head (I don't think the material breaths well).  In addition, expect to see a lot of improperly trimmed long threads that will need touched up before you give it to your little one or they may be able to pull apart seams by yanking on the threads (it's amazing what little hands are capable of doing).Although I didn't think the quality matched up with the price tag, the recipient of the nap blanket loved it.  Of course, I have yet to meet a 2-year old who doesn't squeal with delight over just about anything.It hasn't been washed yet so I cannot comment on how well it launders.  I'll update this review on a later date to address this issue.\n",
      "By far, one of THE best purchases ive made for my baby to date. I spent months researching diaper bags and this one is the best. It is functional and stylish, and cleans up so easily so I know it will last at least a baby or two!\n",
      "This is the third type of window shade we've bought - the others, which were all suction cup only, never stayed stuck. This one is great! We use the \"over the window\" hooks, which are far superior to the suction cups, although it does come with optional suction cups to secure the shade at the top of the window. The bottom of the shade is secured with a suction cup once you pull it down, and so far, it's been attached for 2+ weeks, and has not once come undone. I like the plain color of the shade, and the small, decorative owl - very 'sophisticated!' I would absolutely buy this product again.\n",
      "After purchasing the Graco Ready2Grow Stroller, it arrived a few days later. Assembly seemed a little daunting, but it was pretty easy. There are so many configurations with this stroller, that you do NOT want to lose the manual. My 2 year old was excited about it and can't wait to go out in it. And the newborn's carseat fits just fine. If there was any complaint, it's just that when it folds up, it's still huge. My wife can't handle it on her own. And I'm not sure if it will fit in the trunk of my Corolla. And even if it does, not much room left for groceries.\n",
      "We have a door that goes down to the basement that my husband had to put a latch on because my daughter (who is almost 3) loves to open it.  Problem is -- if you need to go downstairs quickly to grab something, she can still open the door because how can you get back up?  Also if you keep it locked when you're home and someone steps out and needs to come up through the garage, then they were locked out.  This solves all of these problems.  It fits on the door so easily and you can get in or out from either side of the door and your child is unable to open it.I love it, my husband loves it.  We liked it so much, I just ordered 3 more of them for upstairs rooms that I dont want her getting into.  they are a bit expensive at $12 a pop but for my child safety and my convenience I cannot put a price tag on that.  One note is that you cannot totally shut the door.  It will be ajar by an inch or so -- but there is no need to shut the door -- its there so you can easily pop it on and your child cannot get access to the room.\n",
      "Original spare straws to replace Munchkin cups. Nice colours and good material. I replace them withput any trouble. I recommend it.\n",
      "i love the handles it provides for a growing baby easy to drip,my baby drinks from cup with no problem being that she was ebf\n",
      "i got this projection mobile as I wanted something that would help my son get entertained in the crib as he would hate to get into the crib during day time for his naps but also help him fall asleep without me. This was the perfect mobile as he likes to look at the lights and the projection of the animals. Also my son loves to talk to the animals and the fall asleep by himself. He has started taking afternoon naps in his crib which helps as he able to sleep longer.1/21/11 I have used this mobile for 3 months and still love it. My son loves to talk to his animals, coos and laughs when he wakes up instead of crying. He falls asleep in his crib listening to the music and watching the animals. I wish I had got this mobile earlier when he was born.Pros1. Good and relaxing music for baby.2. Projection feature very unique3. Has the option to have the music, heartbeat or 3 different nature sounds.4. Has a remote so you don't have to disturb the baby if it stops.5. Has option for music only, music and rotation and music, rotation and light.Cons1. Remote does not work if its not in direct line of sight.2. Could have off switch to turn off the music rather than using the remote or turn off the entire mobile.3. Requires 4D batteries and if used for 2 times a day for 20 min it lasts for one and half month.\n",
      "If you're looking for a well-made, festive rubber mat, get this. I used it on the corner of my living room, where I set up a little table, chairs and activity area for my 4-year-old daughter. She loves it and so do I. It's perfect and practical! Highly recommend!\n",
      "I thought this baby carrier would be helpful for hauling around my baby niece, sans stroller.  Boy was I right!!  The real strength of this carrier is its versatility.....contains the necessary structural support for newborns, while being able to \"convert\" to a carrier that  works with older babies and toddlers as well.  Although initially a little challenging and somewhat intimidating to figure out (straps, etc.), once you have done so this will prove to be an invaluable purchase.  Looking forward to using this for many months going forward.DYB\n",
      "Easy to put together and very secure.  Not one issue with it since we had it.I have recommended it to friends.\n",
      "I bought this because I am not a fan of the plastic packaging that the wipes we use comes in.  This container holds plenty of wipes for my diaper bag and dispenses them well.  The wipes do seem to dry out a little bit faster in this holder but I am still happy with the purchase.\n",
      "Everyone cracks up when they see this pacifier and they always ask where they can buy one.  I'm mailing one for my grandson and can't wait to see pictures.  Cruel grandmother?  I think not!\n",
      "I have searched for 3 monthes for a gate to fit the opening to my kitchen 64'. This gate is GREAT! Easy to open looks great andthe door automatically closes when you open it. It also screws in to the wall very securly. No complaints here.\n",
      "This is a quiet toy that held my baby's attention from a young age. As soon as she learned to grasp things, she was interested in these bright colored veggies. The lettuce leaves velcro off, which will be good to play with when she gets older.\n",
      "My twins are almost one year old, and they love baby rattles and soft toys that make noise.  Upon first opening the box, I was surprised at how large the Parrot Ball Toy was.  It's not quite a soccer ball, but larger than a softball.  I'd guess 6-8&#34; in diameter.  My daughter especially loves to chew on soft 'flaps', so I figured she would love the wings on the Owl.  Both kids were excited by a new toy, but I think it was just a bit too large to drag around the house in their mouth, or sit and chew on, or swing around like a rattle.The back of the toy is also a bit drab.  All the color is on the front of the toy, and even then, when choosing between the almost earth tones of the Owl or something bring and vibrant, the more vibrant toy seems to catch their eye.  They still play with the Owl a little bit, but more in the 'let's see what happens when I pick this up and immediately throw it' type of play.\n",
      "I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR A BABY SHOWER FOR FIRST TIME PARENTS. THEY LIKED IT. HAD NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE IT BEFORE. IT ARRIVED IN PLENTY OF TIME.\n",
      "We've been using this mobile for over 2 months and we LOVE IT.  My son is now 5 months old and is just able to reach the animals, can't quite grab them yet though.  He never tires of watching the mobile. I even enjoy watching it because each animal is counter-balanced with a stuffed ball which makes the movement a little less predictable.I have 2 complaints: The on/off button is very big and sensitive. A few times we have woken up in the night to the sound of the mobile - my son must have kicked it on in his sleep. I guess that can be remedied with better placement in the crib. Also, it is so LOUD.  I wish I could turn the volume down even lower than low.We have had to replace the batteries once, but otherwise it's been great.  I definitely would recommend this mobile.\n",
      "As any pregnant woman knows, at some point during gestation it becomes nearly impossible to sleep comfortably. When you can't sleep on your back, you can't sleep on your stomach, and your only choice is to balance on your side with your belly slowly pulling you off balance, your body actually gets pretty tired. After getting very little, uncomfortable sleep for some weeks, I searched desperately for relief. I intended to purchase the snooggle full length body/pregnancy pillow since they had it on Target online where my baby registry was. Some time passed and I decided to go straight to Target in person and get the snoogle only to find it was not there. BUT, the Boppy pillow WAS and I got it right away. I have to say that it is one of the BEST products I bought during my pregnancy. I would not have had a good nights sleep without it. Some people complain that the preggo pillows they have bought take up too much room in the bed, but this one is nicely shaped to hug your body and cushion where it is needed without too much extra bulk. The slipcover that comes with it is very pretty and easy to take off to wash. It also comes with a zippable pillowcase that you can fold the whole thing into to make one nice round pillow. I am still using this pillow after my son was born, since it folds nicely in different ways and makes a nice pillow just to recline on. Definitely a MUST HAVE for any pregnant woman! You WON'T regret it!\n",
      "My son LOVES his lil turtle and so do I. It is so bright and fun. He loves to snuggle with him and now has become attached to his little friend. The pacifier is just like the one they give you in the hospital.  Yes,  I would recommend this to any mother with a baby! The turtle is worth the little extra & it is very well made. The picture does not do him justice!!\n",
      "while there were many car seats available that had a good/great safety rating - what really made the decision for us was the ease of use.  My daughter was thrilled when she visited and new exactly how to work it.\n",
      "This is an extra large changing pad that is great for public changing stations. My LO never touches the changing surface it is so large. My only complaint - minor annoyance-is when you lay it out it gets a little air. When you resold it you have this air trapped that I have to squeeze it a bit to get it back in my diaper bag. It isn't a big deal just a little annoying. We have 3 so you know we like them.\n",
      "I searched for a spout cover that was soft, cute, easy to put on and take off, and allowed access to the shower pull. This inflatable spout cover does all those things, and it was inexpensive! Plus, my son loves seeing Lightning McQueen in his bath!\n",
      "I honestly don't know how our Mom's did without these things!  These pillows position baby right in the perfect spot to feed.  I have three!  One for upstaies, one downstairs and my older son uses his for lounging.  Great product!\n",
      "I love this bag beacuse of it's great color,fabric and pockets in side.And the fact that it does not look like an ugly diaper bag. But after 2 months of minor use the inside lining of the bag begun to tear really bad. And for the price of the bag it really should have stayed together alot longer.\n",
      "At first this seemed too pricy but has become the best toy for my 6 month old little girl. The neck and legs are easy to hold, it's easy to squeak, and easy to re-grip when dropped. When you add up the cost of cheaper toys that babies don't really use, this then seems reasonable. This giraffe has been around a long time and I can see why.\n",
      "Two of them crinkle and two of them rattle!  Great colors, tags and corners to grab, and easy to squish.\n",
      "I purchased this bag to replace my Rowdy Sophisticate Bowler (the zipper broke after 2 months of use) and I absolutely love it.  It's very roomy, the material is very durable and the leather accents add class.  The pockets on the inside hold everything!  My baby is using sippy cups now and the side pockets hold them!  The other inside pockets hold diapers, wipes, extra clothes and other small stuff that you wouldn't want floating around the bag.  Even with the pockets full you can still add more stuff in the middle like blankets and snack cups (like Munchkin).  The outside pockets are big enough for snacks, toiletries and medicines as well as bottles or sippy cups.  The changing pad is very much an upgrade from other changing pads.  Plus, it has it's own pocket on the outside so it keeps it out of the way.  I have a Kiddopotamus changing pad that I purchased separately and it fits in there perfectly!  The clutch is really a clutch purse!  It has an inside zipper pocket, credit card slots and a cell phone pocket.  I have a huge wallet (checkbook organizer) and it fits with plenty of room left over.  It snaps on the bag on two rings that are there just for the clutch.  They are very strong and durable so you don't have to worry about it going anywhere. The shoulder strap for the clutch is a little chintzy, but it can easily be replaced with another strap from another purse.  The stroller straps are amazing.  They are made of woven nylon straps that are adjustable with heavy duty clips.  All of the zippers are metal with nylon so that will provide years of use.  I got this bag in the West Side Wave and I may even use it as a travel bag when I don't need to carry diapers anymore!  Great job Skip Hop!\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter (before she was born) and have used it for over 2 years now.  We are thinking about the time soon, when she will move into a bed. I keep trying to pick out \"big girl\" room decor, but can't find anything that I love as much as this, with it's soft pink and sage green... it is simply beautiful.  It has held up perfectly to many washings and lots of snuggling.\n",
      "I think this product is great. It was represented properly and fuctions exactly as it was claimed. I am a little bummed in the aspect that the projection isn't quite what I was looking for, but my daughter loves it and that is what I was going for. The stars will blur the further away from the projected surface they get. Other than that, it's a very cool product.\n",
      "This carseat has gotten excellent reviews.  This is the second one we bought.  We really like the granite color for our gray car- the lazy days gray is too greenish.\n",
      "my friend loved it coz its a presenti really like it coz its very usable and they do deliver the product right on time\n",
      "Some one gave this to me for my baby shower of my daughter.  She started to use it when she was abt 8 months old and now will not make a move with out her blankness so I decided to buy another one just I case any thing ever happened to the original and she loves them both\n",
      "Very well made. After 5 years of daily use, its still in perfect condition. It's soft and easy to clean. The travel case makes it easy to take it with you when eating out. I also like how it does not slip around on a solid chair surface. Would buy another if I needed another one, but this one still has many years left.,\n",
      "If you don't need video, movement alert, temperature, talk-back, or video (we sure don't), this is a great baby monitor. Much better range than theSony Baby Call Nursery Monitorthat we used before, which would get static or no signal even when just a few rooms away in our small house. This monitor has a nice clear signal anywhere we go. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that Amazon's price could be a bit lower.\n",
      "This is a difficult product to rate:I love it because I can adjust the waist so that trousers finally fit my son.I'm disappointed because the clips aren't included with the belt, they really are necessary to buy because not all trousers have belt loops, or even belt loops in the right place to make the product work. It gets expensive when you have to buy both the belt and the clips.I'm also disappointed because after just a couple of weeks use the elastic started popping out of the belt and there was irreversible stretch in the belt. I'm not sure how long it will last but it already looks tatty.\n",
      "This basket is one of the cutest things I've seen. It is also soft and well made. You won't be disappointed! I bought the duck and the bunny.\n",
      "My granddaughter loved this for her Christmas gift. It looks like the one her Mommy uses for her lil brother..\n",
      "Makes pumping so much easier. I'm not a regular pumper, but at first I thought I might have to EP. If you are going back to work or EP this is what you need. I like having it for my once a day pump, If just makes things easier. If the baby cries while I'm pumping I can get up to tend to him and have free hands to sooth him.\n",
      "Fit so much more than I expected. My daughter loves it and can take out and clean up her stuffed animals as sh pleases. She is happy she gets to keep all her &#34;friends&#34;\n",
      "The fabric very soft and comfortable with good quality, the colors coordinates nicely while the design is adorable, cute and delightful\n",
      "Love these seats. Bought two for my five-year old twins. They are able to buckle themselves. They really feel like big boys now. The cup holders are an added bonus!\n",
      "This works great, it is hospital quality for much less. The carry all makes transportation very simple. The cold storage for the milk will keep cool for hours allowing for a long trip and it will still remain cold. The suction is just as the same as the hospital grade equipment; there is little to no leaking and the controllable suction makes this one of the best pumps for the price.\n",
      "I will be buying more of these blankets, for the price the quality is absolutely amazing. I would easily pay twice as much for this and still be satisfied!You won't be dissapointed if you get one, thats all I can say! It is very soft, and adorable ;)\n",
      "Very cute little simple cotton baby bodysuit. Sizes do run a bit on the small side so I would order a size larger.\n",
      "I went back and bought the sage color because I loved the ecru velour crib sheet so much.  Maybe I'll use the other crib sheets in the summer, but now, winter-time, these are the only ones I want to use for our daughter's crib.  She is 3 months old and I love the ecru sheet we got before she was born so much that she got the sage sheet for Christmas from Santa!  I wish they made these for big people! I can't prove it, but I think our daughter sleeps better on these sheets!\n",
      "The crib did take quite awhile to put together and all, but the final results are amazing.Very beautifully designed, great quality... It's perfect... I couldn't expect anything more.  :)\n",
      "I love this night light! It's easy to take around the nursery or the house, it has just enough light to see what you're doing without being enough to really wake the baby, and I love the fact that after about 20 minutes it shuts itself off. My baby likes it to be on the color changing mode when she falls asleep because it's very soothing. This night light has to sharp edges, is perfect size to fit in a little kid's hand when my child gets to where she's old enough to go to the bathroom on her own in the middle of the night, and stays cool to the touch so she will be able to keep it in the bed with her if she wants, then it can sit and charge during the day when it's not needed. Wonderful product! I highly recommend this for everyone!\n",
      "I was a little skeptical about a video monitor but my son was making so much noise upstairs that I needed to know what was going on without going in his room and risk waking him up if he wasn't already.  I absolutely LOVE this!  I don't know how I made is without one for so long.  I love that you can hear and see the baby.  We have it positioned so we can see the whole crib and the picture is great.  The color is not great but you can see what you need.  The night vision works perfect, in fact I think I can see him better at night than during the day.  We've had no problems with the reception or interference.  In fact, there is less interference with this one than the audio monitor we had before.  This an expensive investment but I think it is worth the money to be able to see your baby.\n",
      "I bought this toy as decoration for a baby shower and it is just precious. The couple loved it and are excited for their little boy to be able to play with it someday.\n",
      "Great quality, Great price.  My granddaughters have several Angel Dear products. They are easy to clean and hold up nicely.\n",
      "We have gotten so many compliments on our bedding! It is very cute and would be good for a girl or a boy. We have a baby boy, so we accented the blue, but it would be just as easy to accent the pink. This is a great set that we will have for all of our kids!\n",
      "These nipples are the absolute best!!! My daughter loves the faster flow!  She will down a bottle so much better now that she has the fast flow nipples.  Highly recommend these once your child gets a little older!\n",
      "I really love this diaper bag - the colour is very nice, and it is very easy to use and easy to clean.  I really like the change pad it comes with because it is soft and padded, but doesn't take up a lot of room since it is compact in size.  I like how the bag is lightweight to start off with and it is very convenient that I don't have to bring along another bottle insulator - the side pockets ensure that the bottles stay upright and cool for up to 5 hours.  I love it!!!!  I also double checked about the material peeling, but found out that the company uses a more durable fabric now, so shouldn't be a problem!\n",
      "best toy ever invented! its is adjustable & will fit onto almost anything! my daughter loves this toy! would recommend to anyone!!\n",
      "A fun, well-made, and very practical product.  So great to have something different, instead of the same old staid patterns and colors.  Very happy with the purchase.\n",
      "LOVE this bag.  I have been through quite a few bags and this one has it all.  LOTS of pockets!  Holds everything I need for baby with room to spare for mommy's things.\n",
      "Very hand, durable, and doesn't leak.  My toddler loves it. Would love to have more colors for my boys.Do you sell the replacement straws?\n",
      "I love this stroller?  It is perfect for my 4 year old and 2 year old.  It is sooooooo compact and easy.\n",
      "I gave this as a gift and the couple absolutely loved it. It is a must have for any new mom.\n",
      "skiphop bags are not only great looking but very durable.  even my husband does not mind carrying it.\n",
      "This banana toothbrush was my mom bought to me.It is really cute.My 8-month-old baby loves it.However,the plastics seems not very good.And Its too big for baby's mouth.Not recommended.\n",
      "My daughter loves it! It is nice quality for what I paid , i am very pleased with the duvet . It looks great on her bed.\n",
      "These are a really cute idea and my daughter (9.5 months) enjoys using them. The only downside is that they are SUPER messy! So if you don't mind the clean up they would be a great buy. We don't use them often just because its easier to either puree her food or give her less-messy finger food items.\n",
      "Jolity did a great job getting the baby carrier to us!  It's great and the baby loves being in it.\n",
      "I purchased this Fork and Spoon from Amazon to go with the plate, perfect for little hands,better than any I have bought in the stores, highly recommend for little hands and children that love Elmo.\n",
      "It's a good diaper bag for my baby. It's big, soft a very nice. A good election.\n",
      "It is very cute.  My baby loves it.  Room to hook our favorite toys plus toys already attached.  After reading some of the reviews, I was skeptic, but I am completely satisfied.  No problems at all with the wheels.  No problems with the different heights and very easy to put together.\n",
      "Love it.  Best quality I have every used\n",
      "I buy it to hong kongit's very good\n",
      "These worked great for my toddler!  Love not having to use yucky ol plastic, these are so nice and clean.  Very durable too.\n",
      "I gave this as a gift for a young couple with a baby on the way.They were registered for this crib and seem to really love it.Couldn't believe how cheap it was! A great find!\n",
      "Beautiful, lovely colors! Will be a perfect addition to my granddaughter's nursery. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is considering purchasing it.\n",
      "I was looking for a Marc Jacobs type diaper bag but did not want to pay the big bucks. I decide to purchase this bag and was so happy when i got it. The fabric is really really luxurious. The style is great how you can carry it a few different ways. I think its a great bag. Lots of nice pockets too.\n",
      "I hate to gush too much, but this could possibly be the greatest baby toy ever.  It really keeps my baby entertained.  Things I love:--The toy bar is adjustable so that it can angle down toward the baby so that baby isn't just looking up at the bottoms of toys.--I like the interchangable cards that go in the slots of the toy.  Offers some variety.  And it would also be a good idea to put family photos in the slots as well.--Colors of the toy itself aren't too obnoxious.The only thing I don't care for is the music--very repetitive, and too loud.  We usually have it turned off.\n",
      "I absolutely adore this towel. It is way worth the money because it's something that I know my daughter will be using for a very long time. The hood is a very good size and so is the towel. It's not like one of the many other baby towels you see out there in the market these days, where it doesnt even fit around the baby anymore after 6 months. It even wraps around my body! The wash cloth is very big too, like a regular adult wash cloth size. And it's very soft and nice. I am def happy about this purchase and would recommend this to any of my friends who have kids or are going to have kids and will be my new baby shower item gift to give!\n",
      "Very cute little gift  at a great price.  Nice to use as a hostess gift or would be cute as a wedding shower favor.\n",
      "I love this product and it is now my trademark shower gift for all moms.  It is very durable surviving multiple falls by a clumsy, sleep deprived mom.  My little girl has grabbed it thrown it several times and it still keeps going.My favorite aspect is the knob which shows which breast you should be nursing with.  It is so easy to forget which side was last.I recommend this for any mom!!\n",
      "I bought this after being gievn a diaper genie as a gift. This is much easier to use. You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags. I highly recommend the diaper champ for storing stinky diapers.\n",
      "These are the perfect shape for little AND big hands. I love how I can introduce my toddler to a fork safely. He loves these spoons, and they look fabulous. Great quality, worth every cent. I put them through the dishwasher every day and they still look new after more than a month, no fading at all like I get with other products.\n",
      "Bought this for my great grandson who was 7 months old at the time.  He loves it and I think it is probably one of his favorite toys.  Needless to say, I have gotten him MANY toys.  It is a fun toy and appeals to babies (and adults, too).  Might take them awhile to &#34;master&#34; its operation. I think you would be happy with this purchase!\n",
      "I have every carrier on the market. We had a really hard time getting my son to like any, we all fell in love with the ergo. That worked great but not so wonderful when I got pregnant again! I was still carrying my son and needed something that wouldn't bother my growing belly and I saw that mayim bialik recommended this one, one that I hadn't run across before. It was perfect! I wish I had know about it sooner, I may have just bought this one from the get go. I don't use the pocket so much but the padded should makes a huge difference!\n",
      "cute design I'm sure my daughter will love them! It could be a LITTLE better quality though :-) I love the colors and size!\n",
      "This toy is absolutely adorable! I am so happy we ordered it. Each piece has great detail and so much character. Smaller in person, but perfect size. The texture, colors, and noises each piece exhibits are great!Even cuter then the picture. Love,love,love it!\n",
      "WE HAVE BEEN USING THIS BAG FOR A FULL YEAR NOW AND IT STILL LOOKS BRAND NEW. IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A DIAPER BAG SO WHEN YOU DONT HAVE THE BABY YOU DON'T HAVE WORRY ABOUT CHANGING TO ANOTHER PURSE.  IT'S GREAT AND I WILL BUY ONE FOR MY FRIENDS THAT ARE SOON TO BE MOMS!\n",
      "These are hands down one of the best diapers.  Great quality and super absorbent!  You will not regret purchasing this diaper :)\n",
      "This was just as cute as the picture. It was so soft and the mother I bought it for absolutely loved it.\n",
      "Would recommend for anyone who loves Pocoyo like my grandson.  Would have liked it more if it was 100% cotton.\n",
      "I love this little bag for tossing snacks into the diaper bag.  In the past I would use a ziploc bag for my kids' snacks, but I ended up using a lot of bags, because the ziploc bags got ratty looking pretty quickly.  I love the fact that this bag has a \"real\" zipper and that it is a cinch to wash, while my 2 year old twins love the Dr. Seuss print.  This is the first bag of this type that I have owned, but I can tell you it won't be the last.  I will definitely buy more, especially as my smaller baby gets older as she will have different snacks than the toddlers.  I can also see myself using it with my teenagers to offer some semblance of \"portion control.\"\n",
      "Attention!  That little cloth tag is for a drop of essential oil (I use lavender) and it makes the bag smell so much better! I had no idea what that tag was for for like 9 months! Best liner.  I haven't had any problems with mine, works great.  I also have a planet wise pail liner and it is prettier, but doesn't have the option to make it smell better.  I just use a glad trash can that I bought for $5 and it works great.\n",
      "My 7 month old son just received his Baby Jack Tag Blanket and absolutely loves it! This is the new baby gift item I'll be giving out to friends. I highly recommend this product. It is exactly what I thought it would be given the description and the quality is excellent!Thank you!\n",
      "I bought three of these 1 for my  granddaughter, and 2 for my daycare, I just love it . It is so bright and the kids just love the toy that are on the sides , it keeps them happy.\n",
      "we love these pacifiers.  Can never have enough of them.  The six pack makes it a little easier to always have a clean one.\n",
      "We absolutely love the chandelier!!! My husband had a little issue installing it, but once it was up it was perfect!! It just makes our little girls room look so elegant! Everyone loves it!!\n",
      "This is one of my favorite gifts to buy new moms...they'll get more use out of this gift than just about anything I can think of! Not only is it easy to use, it's dishwasher safe, it can fit just about anywhere, you can store anything in it, the colors are bright and kids like to play with them. I think it's also economical and enviornmentaly friendly since ziplock baggies are so expensive you'll end up saving a lot of money by using the snap apart dish. The best part is that these hold up really well while keeping your snacks/food fresh...I just love these!!!\n",
      "I love these blankets....they are large, soft, and my grandson loves the patterns on them.  I have washed them several times and they are still as good as new.  Great buy!\n",
      "These sheets are pretty thick and good for the money. I like them a lot and so does my two year old! They are a great buy~\n",
      "Thanks to this wonderful diaper pail I never have to smell dirty diapers! The other wonderful part is you can use regular trash bags( I buy the drawstring so I never catch a whiff of the contents) instead of pricey refills!! I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "I bought this for my friend's 2-year-old daughter as her birthday gift. It's a bit big for a 2-year-old, but that actually makes her cuter when she has this bag on her back! The quality is good, too!\n",
      "Great. Just as expected it would be! super cute and comfy , I love how it looks on the mattress\n",
      "i bought the lion and the bull and our grandson loves them. they are his favorite. great idea, very well made..perfect\n",
      "I bought it for my son's bathroom and it looks great. Colorful, perfect size, good quality, easy to apply. Highly recommend! My boy likes it.\n",

      "Great quality, so soft, she loves it so does  our daddy :-)worth the money for sure. Does not have any smell to it. Good product.\n",
      "Love it all\n",

      "Very cute and the kids love it.  Easy for them to handle and use. My young granddaughters were very happy to use them.\n",
      "This decal was easy to apply and looks great on the wall. Kids love it. I recommend this decal to all.\n",
      "This blanket is really soft and pretty cute. We bought this for our daughter but seems like it would be a good gift for a baby shower or something like that also. We love it so far.\n",
      "Super soft and comfortable. My daughter loves them! They are easy to get on and off too! Definitely bought 2 sets\n",
      "Love love love this product, am so happy with it, husband loves it also really am so pleased with it\n",
      "We do cloth diapers and needed a way to take them home at the end of every day from the daycare. These are cute, easy to wash, affordable, and they work great. Highly recommended.\n",
      "My 4 year old uses this at school for nap time - works great, colors are great on sheet.  HE LOVES IT!\n",
      "I loved this product so much, I bought two!  Great quality,You need two so while you're using one you can wash the other.\n",
      "I really love this mirror! It fits easily in my car and is easy to adjust. My son loves it too. I've bought a different kind before and was not impressed. I definitely recommend!\n",
      "My little boy loves vibrations and this has been a great thing to have. I use it for more than just under a mattress. I have put in his car seat and I have really liked using it in his stroller.\n",
      "Our daughter LOVES being in this carrier. I love it because it's easy to throw in a bag, and it's possible to put it on myself\n",
      "I am so glad my husband and I decided to try out Bumgenius.  My son is 3 months old and I've loved using them so far.  We used disposable the first couple weeks while we were getting used to being first time parents, but have used bumgenius ever since.  Even if I used these for only 6 months and then threw them away, I'd still save money, and I would toss one garbage bag instead of hundreds. A few things you might want to know:- We have 24 diapers and I'm happy with that amount, I do laundry every other day.-It's best to have a front-loader washer.  And you really DO need to wash each load twice with an extra rinse cycle.  But that is really not that big of a deal, and up until they start eating solids you don't even have to wash off the poo from the diaper before sticking it in the wash.  We do have the diapers sprayer but haven't used it yet.-we have a cheap plastic garbage pale next to changing table with a washable diaper pail liner in it.  Just take off the diaper, throw in pail, and dump the whole thing in the wash when it's full.  (like I said, this is every other day)-We use gerber washcloths as wipes.  I have a spray bottle with a a mixture that I spray on the washclothes. My son doesn't mind at all that the water is not warm.  My mixture is water, a little Dr. Bronners soap, and a tiny bit of tea tree oil, but there are many different mixtures you can use.  just google it.  The washclothes work great and we just put them in with the diapers.-I would recommend the bumgenius odor spray, it seems to makes a difference.  The smell is not that bad though since you're constantly washing.-you cannot use diaper creams when using bumgenius,  so I have been using breast milk and it works great! For those not breastfeeding I think you can use olive oil as well.  It's gotta be much better for your babies skin anyway.My friend uses the 3.0  all in one on her two year old girl and also loves them.  She uses her diaper sprayer, as I'm sure we will once my son starts eating solids.  Also, these new bright colors are really fun, I like them better than the old colors. We have some of both.  Overall, I find these to be VERY practical, not nearly as cumbersome as I thought they'd be.  There is enough guilt that comes along with motherhood... so do yourself a favor and use bumgenius, no need to buy and throw all those hundreds of disposables away!\n",
      "I have wet bags, pail liners, and a wipe pouch and I love them all. I am very pleased with the durability, and the way these products wash up! Bought one for a friend too and she loves it! Great for cloth wipes!!! Perfect size for an outing during the day and if I need to hang it right on the changing table! Love this wet bag!!!!\n",
      "I love theses pacifiers they are really great!  I Used them for all 3 of my kids and they were the only ones they would take.\n",
      "I have 2 kids in diapers and the diaper champ has been great for us for 2 1/2 years. Easy to use and change. I love that it uses reg bags. :)\n",
      "Great product . My daughter loves it. I can take It anywhere I go. Very easy to set up and take out.\n",
      "I love this diaper disposal system.  I had the diaper genie with my first son.  It was difficult to operate, plus you had to buy the expensive refills.  With the diaper champ, I just use my regular garbage bags (13 gallon glad quick ties).  The unit is very simple to use.  You just stick the diaper in and flip the handle over.I haven't had any trouble opening the unit to change the bags.  I know it is ready for a new bag when the plunger doesn't go all the way down.  I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Cute and Great product!! I buy it for my 20 months son (he love Toy Story movie) and he loves it!! Like I said, Great product and good price!! 100% recommended.\n",
      "I am a first time mom and I like to keep track of everything. This is perfect for a new mom I love this book.\n",

      "My son loves this.  I love it because it comes with a fitted sheet and a flat sheet that is fitted on one end so it does not come untucked.  the sheets are very soft and comfortable.  if your kid likes the cars theme, I recommend this!\n",

We first got a set to try out when she was around 15 months and really starting to try utensils, we loved them so much we got more so we have 4 of each.  She is now 2 and still loves them.  They are a great size for little hands.  I highly recommend these spoons & forks!\n",

      "My son is 8 months old.  We have had this for a few months now, and it is still one of his favorite toys/teethers!  I really didn't think he would take to it like he did.  But he loves it!  The little tabs have that crunchy sound and he loves to chew on them.  And it is easy for his chubby hands to hold.  Great toy!\n",

      "I bought this for my sister. Its her first baby and I wasn't really sure how big it was. But I loved the colors (and she loves these colors). Also it seems like a great bag for after the baby isn't a baby anymore. It doesn't have that total look of being a diaper bag. So when it came I was thrilled because its not small. Its perfect! My sister loves it. I filled it with lots of lotions, shampoos, diapers and things for her gift. So it does hold a lot. I think its a great buy.\n",

      "I loved book bags when I was young...don't know why really...maybe the little compartments I guess. So for my niece who is 2 I wanted to get her a fun book bag and this one was great. Super cute...and even better was that she loves it! The giraffe one is adorable and I love the colors. It was a good quality material too. Yay!\n",

      "I love the Diaper Champ!  I have no problems with odor at all.  And you don't have to buy or use special, expensive bags!  Any trash bag will work and it's great.

      "This is just what I wanted  . Very good quality . My baby loves it. Great Buy.\n",
      "We really love the WubbaNubs.  We have three and they are so cute!  They are great for little hands to hold onto; and they are a lot easier to keep track of than regular pacifiers.\n",
      "This is a great product, so easy to use. I so far have had no smell. It is so easy to use. My daughter who is five loves helping me dispose of her little brothers' diapers. I would highly recommend this diaper pail to anyone. Its nice not to have to buy special liners and so much easier to use than the diaper genie. I can't say enough good things about this product.\n",

      "What a Great Toy, love it!\n",
      "This was a miracle suit for my baby. We were using the rock n play as a sleeper in the bedroom and wanted to transition him to the crib. He hated being flat (the rock n play is reclined a bit) and screamed every time we laid him flat. We were swaddling him in the crib but decided to try this suit. He fell asleep much faster and woke much less often in the sleepsuit. My only wish was that it was smaller (maybe starting at 6 or 8 weeks). We started him in it before 3 months and he was a small baby to start so he swims in it. Also, I heard you aren't supposed to keep your baby in the suit once they start rolling over. This happens for some babies around 4 months so they won't have much time in the suit before it becomes useless.\n",
      "We live in a small apartment and were attracted to the small folding size of this travel crib.  My husband is very handy, so I figured he would have no problem assembling the crib.  After 10 minutes he gave up and said it was way too complicated to do more than once.  If you are going to leave it assembled, it will probably be fine.  If you are looking for something to put up and take down often, this wouldn't be a good fit.  I think we are going to get the Baby Bjorn instead.\n",
      "This crib looks gorgeous, is heavy and sturdily constructed, and wasn't too difficult to assemble. I expect it will last a long time in our home. The box came looking like it was destroyed, but there was no damage at all to the crib itself. We saved a good chunk buying on Amazon instead of a pricy baby store. Really a luxury piece of baby furniture, we love it.\n",
      "I was very disappointed after I washed the crib pad that it was not a full size crib pad, it is only half size\n",
      "if you read the recall info you see that this model does not apply to the recall...this is an excellent high chair. It is definatley not being recalled considering it is illegal to sell recalled merchandise. Im sure it was just a misunderstanding but this is an excellent high chair and is not expensive at all.\n",
      "I think this is a very cute idea as it will fit the MAM pacis we use plus has the stuffed animal. (We didn't want to use the other type with the large round paci) The only issue I have with this one, is getting the angle right when I put the paci in- if it's centered like you think it should be, then the paci is crooked in my son's mouth.  But overall, I am pleased and just wish I had known about this earlier.\n",
      "We love Sophie.  My second daughter received one as a gift and used it while teething.  My third daughter, who is 6 months old now, chewed on Sophie every day.  Until the day she got lost.  Once I realized we weren't going to find her, I ordered another.  The company I ordered from shipped amazingly fast, I ordered on Saturday and she came on Monday.  But, she seems to have been redesigned.  She is smaller than she should be, the description says 7\", but she's barely 6.5\".  Her colors are much more muted than our other Sophie's also.  But, her squeaker is much louder.  She seems overall much squattier and shorter than the other.  She's still a great toy!\n",
      "We use this every day when we run the dishwasher but I wish it was bigger. Also noticed that if you fill the bottom of the basket completely like is shown in the picture that the nipples don't get washed properly. Great idea but would be better if you could actually use the whole thing when filled.....\n",
      "Although this bag is called \"the weekender\" I use it as my diaper bag and I love it. It is perfect because it isn't very deep so you are digging deep into a bag to find anything. Only downside is that there are quite a few pockets on the inside which is a pain if you are like me and can't keep up with which pocket you put something in.\n",
      "I just received my order.  I haven't had a chance to look at the product itself.  I will review that later.  My review is based on amazon itself.  If you live in CA and made a purchase on or a couple days before Amazon started impletmenting tax on orders, check your order form.  My original email confirming the order said no tax.  They still charged me tax.  When I contacted customer service...Rafael said that they charge tax based on shipment date and refused to refund the tax.  Since when is tax charged on a different day than purchase?  When I asked for a supervisor, he would not provide one. Go through your credit card company to get the refund.  I made a large purchase on purpose before tax started being collected and I know many others had the same thought.\n",
      "I have a Prince Lionheart wipe warmer that fits perfectly on top. The diaper bin has enough space for around 14 size 3 Pampers diapers.\n",
      "I'm not a fan of the smell from the chemicals added to Pampers and Huggies. These are odorless and the best day and night diapers we have found. However, every child is different.\n",
      "This holds quite a lot of diapers, and the print was cute! I was able to hold an entire box of newborn Pampers in three rows inside the stacker.\n",
      "Honestly, there is no difference between these and the diapers the hospital gave that were 'pampers' brand and size 1.  Side by side comparison and putting both diapers on baby, both fit the same!\n",
      "The fact that this is a mattress pad for a crib was not very clearly stated. The size should be in the title of the item.\n",
      "My daughter has an einstein around the wold gym/ tummy mat that we've tied/ saftey pinned this into half of it. When she's in her gym se can kick against the piano and swat at all the toys dangleing down. Sure fire way to expend all her pent up engery quickly. The lights and music stimulate her to increased levels of activity and those precious coo's! When she starts scooting around her crib we may put it in there or leave it on the floor to become a point and learn tool.\n",
      "The product turns on the light and reflects the ceiling, causing the child who becomes enchanted as the effect produced by it. Everyone likes when he sees the product on. I recommend.\n",
      "I purchased this product based on a recommendation from my pregnant friend. I am not pregnant but have a herniated disc in my lower back, which is pinching a nerve and causing severe sciatica. This pillow has been extremely helpful, especially after undergoing surgery to remove the portion of the disc pinching the nerve. After surgery, it was difficult to sleep on my back or turn myself over in the middle of the night. This pillow provided the right amount of stability and comfort.\n",
      "I watch my 5 month old grandaughter 3 nights a week and she loves the stars on her celing.  I turn on the night light and play her cd's and she goes off to sleep. It is just enough light to see when she falls asleep when I am rocking her and the stars are wonderful!!\n",
      "At first I thought it had a short!  Then I realized while reading about it online that it turns on when its dark.  &#34;night light&#34;It's adorable!  Small, but adorable!\n",
      "I got the same exact night light for my daughter at the dollar store. They had the same designs and even had the disney princesses there also.\n",
      "Yesterday, I was looking at this Sophia night light for my daughter.  Today, I was in Dollar Tree and bought the same exact one for a dollar... Just an FYI.\n",
      "The container says that it fits all wipes, so we bought it. Our 2 week old screams when the cold wipe touches his bum. After putting it all together and plugging it in we realized that Pampers wipes do not fit in the warmer. It was a huge disappointment!\n",
      "I put diapers on the side with no drawer, and a plastic tub of pampers sensitive wipes on the other side above the drawer. I pulled the drawer half way out and put three pump bottles of hand sanitizer, diaper rash cream, and everyday lotion standing up in the open drawer.i say it sort of sits everything because the wipes tub is just a hair too big and doesn't close properly because it's being squeezed. i haven't tried the changing pad yet, but it can't possibly be waterproof because they sewed right through the vinyl.\n",
      "Honestly, there is no difference between these and the diapers the hospital gave that were 'pampers' brand and size 1.  Side by side comparison and putting both diapers on baby, both fit the same!\n",
      "Best diapers we found, hands down (we have twins and have gone through *many* diapers) ... no leaks and no bad chemicals. The link in my comment below this post will save you $10.00 off your first order.I'm not sure I understand the other review by \"FrenchConnection.\" Here's why:1.) The diaper bundle is $20/week and every time I call in ... I am on hold either not any time at all (meaning someone picks up the phone right away) or for five minutes.2.) Both our children reacted horribly to Pampers and Huggies diapers, causing welts on their skin due to the harsh chemicals added to those diapers. Honest diapers haveNEVER caused ANY reaction to our children because they are chemical free. I find it hard to believe that the diapers \"created a terrible rash.\"3.) The wipes are nice and thick (made out of medical grade cloth) and pick up very well verses the very thin (and in our opinion too saturated) Huggies (when we used to usetheir brand, prior to discovering Honest.4.) Back when we first received our Free Trial, we got SEVERAL emails from Honest Company stating that they will be enrolling us in their monthly subscription and if we wanted tocancel, we had PLENTY of opportunities to do so.They have a ton of other baby and household products on their website as well!\n",
      "My almost-5-month-old daughter poops several times a day, and about half of those include some type of blowout. While this doesn't prevent leg blowouts, I've found that the tighter leg openings of Pampers Swaddlers help there and the Blowout Blocker catches the big mess up the back! I have 3 that I keep in rotation and she wears them almost all the time.\n",
      "I know the gate says it is for light traffic but it was the only one wide enough for the opening we needed. I am 5'3 and it is difficult for me to step over. One of the rubber tips fell off. It is sort of a pain to adjust. All in all it is okay, it looks nice, and definitely keeps my baby in her area.\n",
      "The gate requires a level to install because if it is off in any direction it will pop off and it does so with a good amount of stored energy.  This is due to the top bar being bent out slightly to give it a super snug fit when installed.The first time the gate popped out of place was when our Newfie, who is not accustomed to hardwoods, slid head first into it after attempting to get to some guests at the front door.  He is 160lbs so I'm sure even a screwed in gate would have come off.  I reinstalled using a 5ft level and checked to make sure it was perfectly installed - again.  The second time it came off happened when our cat (all 9lbs of his scrawny self) jumped off from the top of it.  The gate flew out about 4 feet, the tension screws another 4 feet.After that I immediately measured and re-setup the gate using the screw-in holders. Hopefully this will alleviate any future problems.  I would recommend that everyone use these little pieces due to the amount of tension placed on the gate.Regarding installation:  It would be nice if the extension pieces could snap in or screw in in some way. While trying to measure/screw the tension bolts into place it can be a little unwieldy to line everything up.The gate looks very nice, seems to be made well, and the closing/opening mechanism is smooth.\n",
      "I have two for a year and a half now and already had to replace one that a young family member broke. Gate works well overall.  My two issues with it are that there is no real quiet way of closing the gate and it's wood construction.  My baby is a light sleeper and there have been nights where the loud *click* has woken him up.  Also the wood frame over time sags and the bars start to separate from the frame making it not line up with the latch.Overall it's a nice looking gate, but not the most durable.\n",
      "Due to the fact that our crib has a flip down front gate for ease of reaching in, this liner just does not fit properly.  It helps to not allow our child to stick his arms and legs out while sleeping, but is bunched up at the top and the slat ties are not properly placed either.\n",
      "Everyone who talks about the instructions being difficult to follow are right. My husband and I remedied that by tossing them to the side. After looking over all of the pieces a few times, we were able to understand how the gate latched and mounted it on our own. The hinges and latch are made from a very thin plastic. One of our pieces was broken straight out of the box. Luckily, it wasn't the main latch and my husband hit it with plastic glue. Everything is holding up well and the gate is visually appealing. Our son is only 7 months so I'm nervous about when he gets a bit older and starts to climb it. Sometimes I wonder if the hinges/latch should have been metal for added strength.\n"

      "\t\tGranted, I have a large 10 month old (26 lbs, nearly 30 inches). However, it is too short for us. Sitting up unassisted, my baby still leans forward just a tad, so we have out set up the position shown - not rocking, leaning back.  My baby's head goes up past the seat and into the green &#34;canopy&#34; part.  It's nearly hitting the metal rod around the edge.  I am hoping that when we move it to the sitting up position that the shift in weight will keep him from being poked in the back of the head or neck by the metal rod.  It's hard to imagine any 40 pound baby not being too tall for this chair, but then again all babies are different.Assembly was easy - took me about 10 minutes (you just need a Phillips head screwdriver) to assemble.\n",
      "\t\tThese shades say they meet crash test safety standards, but they are so heavy that I would be way too fearful to use them in case they did come off the windows in a crash. I'm sure it's nice to have a shade that rolls up and isn't always in your way, but these just don't seem worth the chance of having them pound on my child's head...it would cause a serious injury I'm sure.\n",
      "\t\tI bought this high chair last week from Amazon. I have a six month old and we are short on space. I was very excited about this chair. It was easy to put together, the fabric wasn't awful, and I could deal with the design of the harness. A big negative is that plastic is flimsy and cheap. Then I put my baby in the seat. My infant is 21 pounds, and as soon as he was placed in the seat, the chair reclined very quickly and he nearly hit his head on the chair back. My first thought was that I had put something together wrong. Instead, I discovered that the design of this particular chair does not allow for the recline option to stay in place, meaning that if you place a tall, heavy infant in the chair, it may or may not swing back suddenly. We conducted experiments with a five pound bag of flour, and it still tilted back suddenly. I couldn't tell you if the chair is defective or just poorly designed.I am sending it back.\n",

      "\t\tWe bought this monitor prior to our child being born.  We did not use it until he was 9 months old and sleeping in his own room.  When I took it out, it worked for about 2 days, and then would not respond when &#34;on&#34; button was pushed.  I submitted a complaint to Summer Infant, and received a confirmation of them receiving the complaint.  I have never heard anything back.  I went back online, and found that I was no longer under warranty, so we basically wasted 200 dollars.  I would never recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "\t\tSo I did thorough research before buying a carrier because I happen to know a lot about toxic chemicals and I settled on the ergo baby organic carrier with the organic infant insert. Well upon arrival I felt the straps of the carrier and guess what was inside? Nope!not organic stuffing like ergo baby states it is EVA foam it's also in the bottom portion of the carrier! I also paid extra for an organic infant insert As opposed to the regular insert and alas there was foam inside the bottom of the insert pillow as well! I called ergo baby and they confirmed that there was indeed EVA foam in both of these items. There are low amounts of formermine inside their EVA foam. Formermine causes reproductive cancer. EVA foam is what playmats are typically made out of. Germany and France have already outlawed EVA foam play mat but of course America Would never do that. We're too concerned about the bottom line. In any event I asked them Why it was stated on the carrier itself, the box the carrier came in,and all of the information on websites Where there was information about the carrier and insert, That it was 100% organic with organic cotton outside and organic cotton inside and why it did it not state that there was EVA foam Inside ? Ergo baby told me legally they didn't have to disclose the fact that the foam was in there. The lady tried to wiggle out of it by saying well this foam doesn't really touch the baby I told her the foam, the chemicals inside the foam everything that has to do with foam off gases and comes through the material! You will probably be in the sun with your baby and  carrier, And with the sun beating down onto the foam It will Ofgas more! You don't want your baby's face is right next to the foam so he's breathing it and even if you get the chew straps, you don't want to mouth anywhere near the carriers straps! i asked to order one without foam. They said they can't accommodate me because it their Warehouse volume is too high to accommodate my needs I said well that figures that's why you're saving money on crap foam and putting babies health at risk instead of filling it with organic cotton stuffing as you misrepresent that you do!! In any event what I ended up doing was purchasing a seam ripper and opening up the seams on both sides of the straps removing the foam with gloves on of course and removing the foam from the bottom portion of the carrier  And from the pillow in the infant insert and then sewing it back up with some organic soy cotton batting. Just be wary people you need to call the manufacturer never trust when they say something organic or non-toxic without first checking all of the materials MSDS reports and facts because there's a lot of companies out there that are green washed and scamming people At the expense of our little one's health!!\n",

      "\t\tI had bought a seat/ladder similar to this when my children were young, and again for my older grandchildren from Target, who no longer sells it.  This one is flimsy and wobbly and wouldn't support a growing child/toddler.  Also, it does not have adjustable height and the ladder is awkward on the new higher adult toilets.

      "\t\tThe whole setup is rickety.  Expanding from 29 to 52 inches is not what you think.  It doesn't slide and meet all points in between, it has the doorway, and two additional panels that you either use none, one or both.  The bolts that screw to adjust the pressure cups on the end only give so much variance.  Even though your doorway may fit within the stated window, it may take some doing to get it rigged right.  Luckily I had multiple widths for the passage I wanted to block, but if you're not so lucky, you may have to use only the doorway and one panel.  Then be left with an awful gap to close on one end from the bolts.  It is \"pressure dependent.\"  When you sit your configuration, count on it falling apart several times before you catch it in the door.  The extra panels slide onto the doorway panel, but don't lock, snap, hook, make you pull AND lift or do anything to force it apart.  The right dog, and it's going to be putting the wear on those points where you will have to constantly adjust it, remount it, and eventually, break.  I wouldn't even recommend this for children.  Especially not on stairs.  Dogs tend to reach a certain point and stop growing, but your kid might just get a little bigger before you know it and crash through this rickety setup.  I hope to use it for about two months, and will not be shocked to be notified of a recall on this gate.  This is a brand I will be putting on my do-not-buy list.  Three stars for my purposes, but two stars for what I expected.edit:  Nice surprise, due to the bars not being straight, a small enough dog can fit its head through a bottom opening, slide up and then sit there jerking its head until you discover it.  I'm glad I was nearby when one of my dogs did that.\n",

It was easy to put together, the fabric wasn't awful, and I could deal with the design of the harness. A big negative is that plastic is flimsy and cheap. Then I put my baby in the seat.

      "\t\tI ordered this with great expectations. I would be able to work and surf without the pesky interruption of having to use the restroom. I got this via UPS and opened it up placed it on my toilet and grabbed my ipad and began to explore what I termed as surf brewing. I spent 8 hours on this little jewel on the very first day and was delighted, while in the middle of a conference call I simply placed my phone on mute so no one would hear my  explosion and remained on my webex while I absolutely blew the toilet up with no worries of anyone knowing the difference. After my call was over I wiped and logged out but when I tried to get up I realized my legs were completely numb and I fell flat on my face on the bathroom floor. What I soon realized was this seat was actually for a child and could not accomidate a grown mans package. My jewels had relaxed inside of the toilet seat and had somewhat swollen dues to me being on the throne for eight hours and were acting as a anchor and when I fell I took the ipad and potty seat to with floor with me, The ipad was shattered and the screen was in a thousand pieces and I had many cuts all over my hands and forehead and when I tried to get up the blood made me slip and bump my head on our tub rendering me unconscious for several hours. In the meantime my wife had arrived home and had tried to call me several times to see where I was to no avail, she assumed I was out on an errand and made herself a snack and sat down to catch up on the walking dead series. I awoke with a splitting headache an soon realized that the potty seat was rather snuggly around the boys as my fall had caused them to swell even more and I had bitten through my tongue during the fall as well. I tried to stand but the potty seat was making that totally impossible and the attempts to remove it brought blood curdling moans from deep within my manhood. I tried in vain to speak and realized my tongue was so swollen from having bitten it in my fall all I could get out were inaudible moans so I began to crawl through my office restroom out into our den attempting to moan my wife's name. Imagine my wife's horror when in the middle of a zombie attack on the show she was watching she looked over to see her husband covered in blood with a kiddie potty attached to his groin crawling across the floor to her moaning and grasping in her direction. She immediately ran out the door and over to our neighbors house where their teenage son was home. Rusty immediately grabbed his pellet rifle and rushed back over to our home and when he saw me trying to crawl back to the bathroom promptly shot me in the nuts from about 10 feet away. I screamed in agony as most of the feeling had begun to return to my roomates and legs and jumped to my feet shattering the torture device attached to my groin and lunged to exact my revenge on Rusty and his pellet rifle. Rusty promptly ran like hell and he and my wife called 911. I in the meantime picked myself up off the floor as I had fallen again during my lunge at Rusty due to my pants and underwear were still around my ankles. I got my pants up and went to the sink to get some water to wash myself off and while I was doing that 7 or 8 police cars showed up and I was told to come outside with my hands up. See when I fell the first time I had bruised my forehead so badly on the toilet my entire face had swollen so my wife had not ever recognized the zombie with a potty around his groin and had told the 911 dispatcher there was a stranger trying to have relations with one of the dog toys in her living room. unfortunately I could not speak as I had bitten my tongue during the fall so I could not alert the officers to my identity. I was taken to the station and after a few hours I was able to explain myself and get some medical attention and be released with icepacks on my head and my little friends.

      "\t\tThe gate requires a level to install because if it is off in any direction it will pop off and it does so with a good amount of stored energy.  This is due to the top bar being bent out slightly to give it a super snug fit when installed.The first time the gate popped out of place was when our Newfie, who is not accustomed to hardwoods, slid head first into it after attempting to get to some guests at the front door.  He is 160lbs so I'm sure even a screwed in gate would have come off.  I reinstalled using a 5ft level and checked to make sure it was perfectly installed - again.  The second time it came off happened when our cat (all 9lbs of his scrawny self) jumped off from the top of it.  The gate flew out about 4 feet, the tension screws another 4 feet.After that I immediately measured and re-setup the gate using the screw-in holders. Hopefully this will alleviate any future problems.  I would recommend that everyone use these little pieces due to the amount of tension placed on the gate.Regarding installation:  It would be nice if the extension pieces could snap in or screw in in some way. While trying to measure/screw the tension bolts into place it can be a little unwieldy to line everything up.The gate looks very nice, seems to be made well, and the closing/opening mechanism is smooth.\n",

The link in my comment below this post will save you $10.00 off your first order.I'm not sure I understand the other review by \"FrenchConnection.\" Here's why:1.) The diaper bundle is $20/week and every time I call in ... I am on hold either not any time at all (meaning someone picks up the phone right away) or for five minutes.2.) Both our children reacted horribly to Pampers and Huggies diapers, causing welts on their skin due to the harsh chemicals added to those diapers. Honest diapers haveNEVER caused ANY reaction to our children because they are chemical free. I find it hard to believe that the diapers \"created a terrible rash.\"3.) The wipes are nice and thick (made out of medical grade cloth) and pick up very well verses the very thin (and in our opinion too saturated) Huggies (when we used to usetheir brand, prior to discovering Honest.4.) Back when we first received our Free Trial, we got SEVERAL emails from Honest Company stating that they will be enrolling us in their monthly subscription and if we wanted tocancel, we had PLENTY of opportunities to do so.They have a ton of other baby and household products on their website as well!\n",

My jewels had relaxed inside of the toilet seat and had somewhat swollen dues to me being on the throne for eight hours and were acting as a anchor and when I fell I took the ipad and potty seat to with floor with me, The ipad was shattered and the screen was in a thousand pieces and I had many cuts all over my hands and forehead and when I tried to get up the blood made me slip and bump my head on our tub rendering me unconscious for several hours. In the meantime my wife had arrived home and had tried to call me several times to see where I was to no avail, she assumed I was out on an errand and made herself a snack and sat down to catch up on the walking dead series. I awoke with a splitting headache an soon realized that the potty seat was rather snuggly around the boys as my fall had caused them to swell even more and I had bitten through my tongue during the fall as well. I tried to stand but the potty seat was making that totally impossible and the attempts to remove it brought blood curdling moans from deep within my manhood. I tried in vain to speak and realized my tongue was so swollen from having bitten it in my fall all I could get out were inaudible moans so I began to crawl through my office restroom out into our den attempting to moan my wife's name. Imagine my wife's horror when in the middle of a zombie attack on the show she was watching she looked over to see her husband covered in blood with a kiddie potty attached to his groin crawling across the floor to her moaning and grasping in her direction. She immediately ran out the door and over to our neighbors house where their teenage son was home. Rusty immediately grabbed his pellet rifle and rushed back over to our home and when he saw me trying to crawl back to the bathroom promptly shot me in the nuts from about 10 feet away. I screamed in agony as most of the feeling had begun to return to my roomates and legs and jumped to my feet shattering the torture device attached to my groin and lunged to exact my revenge on Rusty and his pellet rifle. Rusty promptly ran like hell and he and my wife called 911. I in the meantime picked myself up off the floor as I had fallen again during my lunge at Rusty due to my pants and underwear were still around my ankles. I got my pants up and went to the sink to get some water to wash myself off and while I was doing that 7 or 8 police cars showed up and I was told to come outside with my hands up. See when I fell the first time I had bruised my forehead so badly on the toilet my entire face had swollen so my wife had not ever recognized the zombie with a potty around his groin and had told the 911 dispatcher there was a stranger trying to have relations with one of the dog toys in her living room. unfortunately I could not speak as I had bitten my tongue during the fall so I could not alert the officers to my identity. I was taken to the station and after a few hours I was able to explain myself and get some medical attention and be released with icepacks on my head and my little friends. Other that that great product.\n",
      "\t\tBest diapers we found, hands down (we have twins and have gone through *many* diapers) ... no leaks and no bad chemicals. The link in my comment below this post will save you $10.00 off your first order.I'm not sure I understand the other review by \"FrenchConnection.\" Here's why:1.) The diaper bundle is $20/week and every time I call in ... I am on hold either not any time at all (meaning someone picks up the phone right away) or for five minutes.2.) Both our children reacted horribly to Pampers and Huggies diapers, causing welts on their skin due to the harsh chemicals added to those diapers. Honest diapers haveNEVER caused ANY reaction to our children because they are chemical free. I find it hard to believe that the diapers \"created a terrible rash.\"3.) The wipes are nice and thick (made out of medical grade cloth) and pick up very well verses the very thin (and in our opinion too saturated) Huggies (when we used to usetheir brand, prior to discovering Honest.4.) Back when we first received our Free Trial, we got SEVERAL emails from Honest Company stating that they will be enrolling us in their monthly subscription and if we wanted tocancel, we had PLENTY of opportunities to do so.They have a ton of other baby and household products on their website as well!\n"

      "1.0 Be careful with this old model. It only has a THREE point harness. My 7 month old son fell on his head when he leaned over without the tray on. The right strap came undone, the left strap held him suspended for a second, and then he slipped out and fell on his head. We called 911 and went to the emergency room. Tomy has a newer model with a FIVE point harness. They should not be selling these old ones anymore when they know it is an inferior product. I sent Tomy and the CPSC an email about the fall. I will destroy the chair after they contact me. Also note that in 2007, this similar high chair was recalled because the straps came apart from the chair.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEDecember 6, 2007Release #08-120Firm's Recall Hotline: (866) 725-4407CPSC Recall Hotline: (800) 638-2772CPSC Media Contact: (301) 504-7908RC2 Recalls The First Years(tm) Children's Feeding Seats Due to Fall HazardWASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the firm named below, today announced a voluntary recall of the following consumer product. Consumers should stop using recalled products immediately unless otherwise instructed. It is illegal to resell or attempt to resell a recalled consumer product.Name of Product: The First Years Newborn-to-Toddler Reclining Feeding SeatsUnits: About 100,000Importer/Distributor: RC2 Corp., of Oak Brook, Ill.Hazard: The restraining straps can pull out of the waist strap slots, posing a fall hazard to young children.Incidents/Injuries: RC2 has received 38 reports of straps pulling out or nearly pulling out of waist strap slots. There have been 12 reports of children falling out of the chairs.Description: The First Years Newborn-to-Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat can be adjusted between reclining and upright positions.

      "1.0 My 10-month-old son was enamored of his little friend's activity cube. I went on the hunt for one to give him for Christmas (his friend's model is no longer produced), and found this well-reviewed cube, which we happily snapped up from Target for about $[...].The baby loved it, but within one day of playing with it, the bottom brace for one of the little doors that opens and shuts, swung down. Turns out, the hot-glue-and-small-metal-pin construction they use was at fault. It appears that one of the metal pins was missing, causing the brace to swing down, which made the door fall off--including the two, inch-long, sharp metal pins that act like hinges. These two pins were loose on the floor; thank goodness I was right there and saw it happen, or they would have gone right down my son's throat (he was reaching for them as soon as they fell out). That was the end of that. We returned it to Target immediately.When I was researching activity cubes, I wasn't concerned with the toy tipping over--I figure my son is going to fall down quite a lot, and get bumped by things over the years--but these tiny metal pins are truly dangerous and could lead to serious time in the emergency room and hospital.Due to the poor construction of this toy, I can not recommend enough that you look elsewhere for a better-constructed option. I will be contacting the manufacturer about this frightening flaw to their product.\n",

We put her on it and, with a parent guiding her gently, with one hand on her back and the other holding her hand and the handlebar, we proceeded to let her rock gently.Immediately, the front chest area of the ladybug &#34;fell&#34; forward as if it had come off a stand or something inside the body of the ladybug.  The rocker went forward way too much and our daughter was jutted forward.  Had it not been for the parent right next to her, I believe she would have flipped headfirst over the rocker.  We attempted to use it again and the same thing happened. We put the rocker aside.Having repeatedly attempted to help her enjoy the rocker safely in the past year, it now sits in her room, with the tag on, and she uses the musical buttons and that's it.What a waste.  Today we once again attempted to let her use the rocker in a final attempt to enjoy it, and despite a parent sitting right next to her, my daughter rocked gently twice and flipped headfirst over the handle.  She hit her chin on the handle, splitting her chin open and the rocker fell over on her.With our experience, and having searched many websites selling this product and hundreds of reviews, it is now unequivocally my opinion that this product is unsafe. I've filed a report with the Consumer Product Safety Commission.  I have contacted the company requesting a statement with regards to their plan to recall or issue a product alert.\n",

      "1.0 I gave this product one star because I had to but would have given it zero stars if possible!!!Like other parents, our daughter was playing with this toy and got Sophie's front leg lodged deep down in her throat. She could not breathe and was gagging. Luckily, my husband was there to dislodge it from her airway and she spent the next few hours coughing because the incident had irritated her throat so badly.We had previously loved this toy but can no longer let our 6 month old play with it. It would be a very easy design fix to just shorten the legs so there is no chance that a child can choke on them instead of how it is currently designed with finger-like legs that are too long and can easily get stuck in a child's airway.I know there are a few reviewers out there that blame incidents like these on parents not paying attention and/or have some sort of emotional attachment to this toy and therefore discount any negative reviews as coming from parents who have way to much time on their hands but this toy is just plain UNSAFE! We filed a complaint with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (who is currently investigating the product) and notified Vulli (who sent us a generic form letter stating how it has been sold in France for 50 years without incident - which is hard to believe since 10% of the reviews on Amazon have describe similar incidents). I encourage any other parent who has had this happen to file a report with the CPSC. It is easy to do and it might just help to save a child's life. Unfortunately, the CPSC will not recall the product until enough people file complaints, or God forbid, an infant dies. Amazon should definitely pull this product from its website!!!\n",

      "1.0 The crib itself is adequate. We bought it because it was the cheapest cherry one on Amazon, at the time about $70. I would not pay as much as it is listed for now - nearly double. There are much fancier, more detailed crib designs out there in that price range.When used in the toddler bed position, my toddler jumped on the bed (of course!) and the stabilizer bar snapped. It is cheaply made - not one continuous piece of wood, but rather had a seam about 1/4 into it where 2 pieces of wood had been joined together.I stopped using the bed (thankfully this happened right as we were transitioning him to a twin size big boy bed) and contacted Dream On Me about getting a replacement. The crib had only been in use for 16 months or so (we had a different one for the first 6 months of my son's life that was drop-side... we replaced it with this one due to safety concerns). I was told by the contact at the company that they had the part in the warehouse and it would arrive within a week.When I followed up that email about 2 weeks later asking where the part was, I was told it was out of stock, and to just continue to use the crib in it's broken state (!!!). Keep in mind, the part that broke is called a STABILIZER BAR.I was a bit gobsmacked that an infant item manufacturer would tell me, in writing, to just keep using a broken crib. I attempted to locate a CEO or higher-up's email and found none, so I called the company to try to get an alternate email. The woman I spoke with was so rude she was bordering on being hostile and aggressive, and she jealously guarded any one else in the company's email address, and refused to give me contact info for anyone but this one person who I had already dealt with.At this point I have forwarded the email to the CPSC and Consumer Reports. I wrote on their Facebook and have asked my friends to share about what is going on with their potentially fatal advice to use a broken crib.I then heard back from this same person. She is now backpedaling and saying she never told me it was shipped and can make no guarantees. Her original email said, and I quote, \"Therefore; you shall receive the stabilizer bar within next week.\"I have never dealt with such a shady baby product company. I am looking to resell the crib as my son has outgrown it. I can't do that if it is broken. I also can't reuse it myself if it's broken. Hopefully they step up and send me the part. I have offered multiple times to pay for it, even though they offered it for free, as I know my son is the one who broke it, and I take full responsibility for that. Dream On Me's response though?\"The stabilizer bar didn't break due to a crib malfunctioning, but because the child was jumping in the crib according to your e-mail. Cribs are not made for children to jump in them. \"Yes, that's right parents: This crib is not made to be jumped on. This CONVERTIBLE crib that is mean to be used as a toddler bed. If your toddler ever jumps on it, evidently this company has no responsibility whatsoever for what happens to your child's life and limbs, in their eyes.Caveat emptor. I would avoid this company's products if at all possible. I will update if and when I am able to obtain a replacement stabilizer bar to use this crib safely. Frankly, after the manner in which they have conducted themselves, I will never buy one of their products ever again even IF they do make this right.ETA:I contacted the CPSC regarding this company's deplorable behavior (lying and advising a parent to use a broken crib). The CPSC Compliance Officer was able to contact the company president. So, someone higher up than the misinformed, defensive peon whom I was dealing with (Jamie E.) is aware of what the official voice of this company is advising parents in writing to do. Unfortunately the stabilizer bar is out of stock and evidently will never be back in stock ever again.I am left with a disposable crib - it's broken, I can't get it repaired. I can't resell it in good conscious. I can't use it again myself. I'm not even sure my local Goodwill accepts cribs. I will probably have to pay to dispose of this at the dump.I have yet to get a single apology from this company - no apology for lying, for the potentially fatal advise to use a broken crib, for not having a replacement part available. Nothing but rudeness and disingenuous blame-shifting while they hide behind semantics.I will NEVER buy another Dream On Me/Mia Moda product again. This company should just advertise for Graco, because they are sure sending my baby-related dollars their way.Hopefully the CPSC takes some kind of action against them for advising parents to use broken cribs.\n",

      "1.0 WARNING to all owners newer model Peg Perego SIP 30/30 Infant Seats. It has two major defects.1> Defective part causes cuts on baby's heels and legs.2> Defective latch can cause seat to fall out of Pliko P3 stroller and have baby land on ground.Peg Perego's SIP 30/30 Infant seat is defective and they have not made registered customers aware of it.  They are not taking responsibility for the safety of the children using this seat.  They have been aware of the first issue since the beginning of summer 2008.The first issue with the seat causes cuts. We discovered lacerations on our son's ankles for over a month but could not figure out what was causing them. On a road trip we discovered a large bleeding gash on the back of his ankle about  the size of a DIME. We traced the source to the SIP 30/30 car seat's plastic strap cover near the feet. There was blood on the cover and the edges were sharp enough to cut my finger.  When I called Peg Perego, it took over an hour to get through to their customer service. Once I did, I discovered over 50 children have already been injured and they anticipate FOUR THOUSAND seats could have this issue. DO NOT follow their instructions to remove the plastic cover until receiving the replacement. The metal latch further cut up the back of our son's legs while waiting for the part. It took almost 4 DAYS to get the part from them instead of shipping it priority overnight.It is Peg Perego's RESPONSIBILITY to inform registered seat users of this dangerous issue, yet they have done NOTHING to warn people. Not even an e-mail. They plan to ship the parts when they have replacement. It has been almost 5 months since they first learned about the issue. How many more children will be injured before they make the public aware of this defect. Since discovering this issue, I have told every parent I see with this car seat about this issue. Their response is normally \"I was wondering where those cuts where coming from.\"The second issue with the seat is latching into Peg Perego's Pliko P3 stroller.  The infant seat has two possible latch points. We attached the seat to the stroller using the outside latch. We heard both sides of the seat \"click\" as explained. While pushing the cart the infant seat fell off the stroller and landed on the sidewalk with our son head down and screaming. We were lucky the stroller wasn't stopped by a street where it could have fallen in front of a car. The fact it can even latch to something that will not hold the seat, much less EASILY latch,  is a SERIOUS design defect that is extremely dangerous to children. It could be fatal.Peg Perego needs to take responsibility for their poorly designed products and let people know about these issues. Hopefully as a buyer you will review this and evaluate if their products are safe for your children before buying and they are injured.\n",

      "1.0 Rumford, Maine-In my very busy 51 years of life, I have taken care of 3 grandparents, raised 10 children (3 of my own and 7 foster children some with special needs), co-founded an area homeschool organization in rural Maine, owned businesses ranging from consultant in management and marketing to international distribution, served on municipal finance committees and planning boards, been a Girl Scout and a Boy Scout leader, and much more to now find myself as the publisher of a digital paper and grandma to a growing brood of grandchildren.  My advice and recommendations are sought daily from every demographic on a wide array of subjects.In recent months, I have been repeatedly asked for my recommendation on strollers by family members, friends, and acquaintances.  It has been quite some time since I have had need of a stroller and took to researching based on my past experience and my observations.  This has also worked out to be an opportune time to be conducting this kind of research as I have the perfect test subject, a 2 year-old granddaughter who is spending several days a week with grandma while her dad is working in the area and mom is attending college classes.Candice Casey is the Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of RiverValleySun.com.From the years of my frequent stroller uses from 1985 through the mid-90s, when I had small children in my home and used both single and twin models, I know certain designs I would not recommend as the bar for pushing is too low making operation hard on the back (a postpartum back is already unhappy) as the operator is forced to bend down to grasp the push bar making the overall experience unpleasant.  I also found the distance between where the stroller required me to stand and the rear axle was often cramped leading to an uncomfortable shortened stride at best and tripping at worse.Along the same lines of a too short distance between operator position and rear-axle, has been too narrow a rear wheel base frequently putting the wheels themselves right in line with my feet.  I am of average build so if I had a problem I knew larger women and men would have an even bigger problem with both insufficient distances between operator and axle and between the rear wheels.Many models I previously owned and those I looked at in my search, though expensive (I paid $200 for my twin stroller in 1990), were cheaply made, unstable, and did not provide good support for the child(ren).  These too I would definitely discourage use of even in mall type settings as these are even more dangerous when the inevitable temptation to hang a bag from a handle is not ignored and the top heaviness results in a tip over with, at the very least a frighten child, more likely injury.  I also took note of weight limits of the models and these varied widely from as little as 30 lbs. and up to the 76 lb. capacity of the BOB Motion.BOB Gear Motion is the latest introduction to the line with its debut in January of 2013.  This model was developed in response to requests for an everyday stroller (non-jogger), and it blends the quality/durability of a BOB including suspension, pneumatic tires, etc. combined with a the more compact design consumers had been requesting to meet their needs in an everyday stroller.  Currently the Motion is only available through REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.) and REI.com for $349.00 US.It is important to take into consideration the weight of a rapidly growing child, a loaded diaper bag, mom's (grandma's) stuff, water bottle, and potential items that may be picked up along the way.  A stroller that will only accommodate an infant and a diaper bag are not a good choice as in a matter of months baby will exceed the weight limit all by themselves.  Much better to purchase a stroller that will accommodate the child from birth through age five like the Revolution SE when the child will no longer be utilizing a stroller but on their own two very active little feet.  In addition, a much better investment is a stroller that will accommodate whatever other paraphernalia may be added to the load right from the start and not risk a failure and potential injury from overloading.Another important consideration is how easy the stroller is to push over a variety of terrains and weather conditions.  A stroller with small wheels will quickly bog down in the snow of northern states, under sandy or muddy conditions, or when coming into contact with even the smallest of obstructions including pot holes that can potentially cause the stroller to flip.I was able to borrow a jogging style stroller from a friend briefly and learned that the jogging style, not available when my own children where young, is a much better choice than other models.  Umbrella models are particularly to be avoided as these models tend to be structurally week, lack support for the child, and tend to have high centers of gravity making them very unstable.  The jogger I borrowed and those I researched have much more comfortable height push bars, larger wheels and the best have a front wheel that can be locked in a straight line position for rough terrain and conditions as well as jogging/running or allowed to turn on dry surfaces and indoors when used for walking.In my research, I have observed that not all push bars are created equally  with some appearing to be more ergonomically designed in ways beyond height such as large padded gip areas and attached wrist safety straps. Related to the bar issue is the width of the stroller.  A stroller with rear wheels that are either too close to the operator or to close together pose a serious threat of tripping which can result in serious injury to the operator and the occupant.The model I borrowed, while having larger wheels, larger than the wheels on the strollers I had 20 years ago, did not have wheels as large as some models my research uncovered.  Additionally the wheels on the briefly borrowed model where not air filled but solid resulting in greater vibration for me and my granddaughter as well as a much rougher ride for her.After much research, I contacted BOB Gear, manufacturer of the Revolution SE Stroller to obtain this model to test with my new best test buddy and granddaughter, Delaney.  The Revolution SE MSRP is $449.00 US though it is available as of this review on REI.com for $399.00, Amazon.com for $313.33 and through other sellers at varied prices.  It is well worth the time investment to shop around.My intention was to look at design, ease of use, features, and the effect of the large wheels with air filled tires that I believed would make this stroller functional even on snowy days in Maine, Maine's terrible unmaintained sidewalks, and on my beloved Florida Beaches.  As an active grandmother who believes firmly in getting out daily for exercise and in getting my granddaughter out every day for fresh air, as do many of the mothers who have consulted me, it was important to me that the stroller go through any weather.  I believed winter was the perfect time to put this stroller to the test. If the stroller navigated the often deep, often slushy snow, and slippery ice of the Western Mountains of Maine in January, I had every confidence it would be a success anywhere.Past experience has taught me the quality, qualities, and characteristics of a product often lie in the products history.  When a product is developed out of a personal need, there can be a much higher expectation that the product will be outstanding.  The history of BOB held great promise.In 1994, Roger Malinowski, a bicycle industry maven, met Philip Novotny, an airline mechanic, in the California town of San Luis Obispo. Philip had turned a decrepit beach cruiser bike into a versatile, lightweight, single track bike trailer.  Novotny called his invention the YAK and was rolling them out of a machine shop on a small scale. Roger knew a great idea when he saw one and together, they took Philip's invention and built a booming business with the trailers.Originally, the company was aptly named Beast of Burden as the trailers carried the load for the cyclist.  As is so often the case with a name that is a whole lot of mouthful, the acronym BOB took over and stuck.Out of a simple idea frequently comes the very best innovation.  BOB was not to be an exception.  What made the BOB trailer so remarkable rested in how it connects to the bike: the patented BOB Quick Release attachment system, an innovative mechanism that takes advantage of one simple fact: all bikes have a rear axle. What better place to hitch on a bike trailer? This provides optimal towing performance, excellent aerodynamics, the lowest possible center of gravity, compatibility with virtually every bike on the road and excellent handling characteristics as well. The Yak trailer revolutionized the way bikes transport gear and as a result, it has become the world standard for bicycle tourists, commuters and enthusiasts.Man does not live to ride or live alone.  When Roger and Philip began their families, inspiration was bound to hit again.  The two set out to design and build a superior jogging stroller that held the same high standards as their bike trailers.  The result was the BOB Sport Utility Stroller, complete with patented suspension system, tough polymer wheels, easy-fold frame, a reclining, padded seat and several other features no one had ever put on a stroller before. \"We wanted the best of a bunch of worlds,\" says Roger. \"A lightweight, high-quality stroller that you could still take running, hiking or off-road and also fold up easily and compactly. The fact we could put all of these elements in one stroller is what really attracted people to it.\"Of course, no successful product can be introduced without going through rigorous laboratory testing. \"We used our kids,\" says Roger. \"Out on the driveway. They squeaked, burped, cried, hurled, scratched, ripped, kicked, tripped, clawed and jumped on the prototypes we gave them. It was great. Those kids helped us raise the performance levels and quality of the stroller farther and faster than we may have been able to otherwise.\"I put this same product testing method to work for my review with the help of my 2 year-old granddaughter and others in the community who were very willing to join in with the testing.  We adults soon learned we had very eager and enthusiastic young assistants.It wasn't long before Phil and Roger had a successful product and the resources they needed to expand their features and product line. Soon after the Sport Utility Stroller hit the streets, customers started asking for a two-seat stroller, which led to the introduction of the Duallie in 2001. Two years later, IRONMAN (MSRP $409.00 US, IRONMAN Duallie MSRP $559.00 US) was looking for an intrepid stroller worthy of being associated with the world-famous triathlon endurance race. I have to agree, it is not surprisingly they turned to BOB. The IRONMAN Stroller, with its lightweight, high-pressure tires, stiff shock absorbers and close association with the grueling event, raised the company's visibility and awareness among athletic parents.In 2005, BOB introduced another innovation that revolutionized the stroller: a swiveling front wheel. No longer would parents have to tip their strollers backwards to make a sharp turn or awkwardly maneuver congested areas. The new stroller was called the BOB Revolution and it was nothing short of it. The rotating front wheel made turning tight corners, walking narrow aisles and navigating crowded sidewalks a sheer breeze.  I would add that the ability to lock the front wheel to keep it in a straight line avoiding \"plowing\" in snow, slush, and deep sand or mud is nothing short of genius. When locked forward, the front wheel is ideal for uneven terrain whether a wooded trail, pothole riddled sidewalk or for faster speeds.In 2006, attracted by a favorable business climate and a lifestyle conducive to its philosophy, BOB moved its corporate offices to Boise, Idaho. As in California, many of the employees rode their bikes to work, sometimes taking new stroller or trailer ideas home for a little product testing.  The mother of invention culture of BOB lives on.In 2011, BOB Gear was acquired by Britax, a manufacturer of premium car seats, strollers, baby carriers and accessories.  Since its founding in Britain in 1939, Britax had established itself as a trusted juvenile products brand, known for a commitment to thoughtful, innovative engineering of safe, top-quality and intuitively designed products.  Britax and BOB Gear were a perfect match in philosophy and approach.It is easy to understand that the addition of BOB Gear to the Britax family reflects the company's commitment to offering a full line of strollers to meet the modern family's lifestyle needs, and continues the cherished BOB Gear legacy of quality and innovation.  The marriage of Britax and BOB Gear came straight from the heavens and was guaranteed to build trust and loyalty of children, parents, and grandparents.Britax USA, and now BOB Gear, are located in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Together they employ more than 200 people.  For more information please, visit [...]The big test began in our household with a UPS delivery of the Revolution SE on January 9, 2013.  Contained in the modest sized box was one instruction manual, three aluminum alloy wheels with real tires requiring inflation to 30psi, and \"the stroller\" assembly.The cover of the instruction manually says !TAKE TIME.  I can think of no great advice since you are about to put your most precious cargo into this stroller.  DO READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY!  That is not to say that the instructions are difficult to follow, but this is not your basic cheap stroller with plastic wheels permanently mounted on a metal rod serving as an axle.  What is in this box is a state of the art highly engineered design, with state of the art components that you must understand, install and operate properly for best and safe results.  It is important that every operator understand how to properly attach the wheels and adjust the, yes, real shocks!  It is also very important to ALWAYS use the wrist safety strap and to properly utilize the 5 point passenger harness and brake.  All of this is careful explained in easy to understand language in the instruction manual.It is recommended that this model not be used with children under 8 weeks of age without an infant car seat adapter and compatible infant car seat.  The logic behind this recommendation is obvious.  Just as a child under eight weeks should never be placed in a car without a proper rear facing infant car seat for restraint and protection, the addition of the car seat to the Revelation SE provides a safe, secure, supportive environment for your under 8 week old precious cargo.  The car seat adapter is purchased separately for around $50.  BOB wisely advises consulting with your child's doctor to determine readiness for the stroller with or without the car seat as all children develop differently.It is recommended that the stroller be used for walking only with infants 8 weeks to 8 months.  Again, talk to your child's doctor to be sure your child's development is suitable for stroller activity.  Jogging/Off-Road is listed for ages 8 months to 5 years.  Yes, this stroller is going to get you and your child through a lot of years making this a fantastic investment.From my \"parenting\" days with a stroller, I don't recall ever using the then \"state-of-the-art\" models available to me past age 3 with my children.  I am convinced that I will be using the BOB Revolution until the passenger exceed the 70 lbs (occupant and luggage) weight limit and/or my young adventurers exceed 44 inches in height (nearly 4 feet tall).  This is a stroller designed for adventures with your bundles of joy from birth to kindergarten or beyond.The Revolution is equipped with adjustable quick release cam device on the front wheel and the rear frame for rear wheels.  The design makes for very smooth, resistance free rolling and easy compaction to fit in small vehicle spaces for transport and small closets for storage.  Be sure to read and understand the installation of the wheels.  If you have any questions, BOB Gear by Britax Customer Service (800) 893-247 or a BOB dealer will gladly instruct you on the proper technique for safely installing and removing the wheels as well as inspecting them before each use.  You can also find FAQ's and installation video's at [...].  The removal, installation, and inspection, once you understand them are extremely quick and easy.  The instructions are very easy to follow.  The instructions are very \"user friendly\" and clear with lines like, \"It takes considerable force to securely clamp the wheel.  If you are able to completely close the quick release without wrapping your fingers around the dropout and the quick release lever does not leave a visible imprint in the palm of your hand, the tension is not adequate.\"  I found the \"not leave a visible imprint in the palm of your hand\" very reassuring and helpful in determining if I had the tension properly adjusted.  I adjusted the tension until I had to wrap my fingers around the lever to close it and the lever left an imprint in my hand.  Having that impression was a great confirmation I had the proper, secure tension to keep my bundle of joy safe.Always be sure to use the brake on the Revolution!  This is a very smooth operating stroller with little to no resistance to motion.  These traits make this the best when it comes to a nice smooth effortless ride.  These traits are just what is needed when out walking or jogging to prevent fatigue.  At the same time, the outstanding engineering of the Revolution makes it easier to inadvertently put the stroller in motion.  So always use the brake and always use the attached wrist safety strap to keep you always in control of the stroller even if you fall, loose footing, or become distracted.As I stated early on in this review, this model is equipped with walk mode (swiveling front wheel) and jog mode (with front wheel locked straight for off-road, jogging, snow, slush, deep sand or mud conditions).  No engineering or expense was spared in the locking mechanism.  The mechanism is secure, strong, and easy to operate and made of high quality materials, not cheap plastic.The wheels on the Revolution are high impact polymer construction and the frame is aluminum!  This stroller is equipped with tires with standard stems that you must inflate to 30 psi!  The front wheel with inflated tire is an amazing 12.5 inches in diameter which prevents the stroller from getting hung up on rough terrain.  The rear wheels with inflated tires are an astonishing 16 inches in diameter; that is as big as some cars!  Big wheels make for a much smoother, safer ride as do the inflated tires.Those big inflated tires pretty much eliminate vibration and shock.  But BOB went further by engineering in real adjustable shocks!  The shocks adjust for the child 40 lbs. and under and 41 to 70 lbs.  The shock adjustment is extremely easy to make and requires no tools.Also engineered into the Revolution is tracking adjustment.  Just as you have your car aligned for proper handling and steering, BOB has engineered in a simple to use tracking adjustment to assure the stroller is always going in a straight line with no pull to the right or left.  This reliable straight line tracking is very important when jogging or running.No shortcuts were taken with the parking brake either.  The brake is not plastic but all metal!  The brake is solid, easy to operate with a substantial foot pedal, and secure in the on and off positions.When I borrowed a stroller for my granddaughter, it took a frustrating and painful 30 minutes to adjust the restraint.  My granddaughter was understandably frustrated and my back ached from bending over for 30 minutes to adjust the 3 point restraint to her height and diameter.  The design required that I remove the slide on shoulder strap padding and unthread the straps through the seat back to accommodate her.  This would be particularly annoying in many climates where a heavy winter jacket may be required on day causing the necessity to raise the straps up a slot to have the next use be in very warm weather with no jacket requiring the straps be rethreaded again.On the BOB it was fast and simple, under 1 minute, to make the necessary adjustments to the 5 point restraint.  The shoulder straps are each equipped with padded covers that are fastened with Velcro eliminating the threading through a fixed tube hassle I dealt with on the borrowed stroller.  The BOB design was a synch to remove, adjust the straps and reinstall the first time out.  The buckles were easy to operate and then a quick pull on the lap belt rings made for a snug restraint to the comfortable, supportive seat my granddaughter loves.The seat back is easy to recline or return to upright.  The canopy is spacious with excellent shade adjustments.  The canopy is even equipped with a \"sunroof\" with shade cover that is easy to lift to check on your precious cargo or let filtered sun light in.The cargo basket underneath is adequate for carrying a modest diaper bag and parent's/grandparent's necessities.  The rear seat pocket is ideal for storing the manual for reference in a Ziploc bag, keys, and other small objects.  There are also two small seat pockets for the child's possessions.Revolution does not come equipped with handlebar console or snack tray, though they are available accessories ordered separately.  I found the absence of the console and snack tray to be huge pluses and here is why. Past experience with the \"borrowed stroller\" with the built in console and snack tray as with previous models I owned that had a belt, no shoulder harness and no crotch strap but depended on a cross bar with center divider to keep the child from sliding out led to frustrations.  First off, the console was mounted on the push bar was positioned to the rear (towards me) of the push bar.  This was awkward from both the standpoint of pushing the stroller with anything in the console, like my Brita bottle and my granddaughters Baby Brita which where forever tumbling out when we went over rough terrain.  Now the Revolution is much smoother with its big wheels and wonderfully engineered suspension but, the console and contents would still tend to be in the way.  As for a snack tray for my little honey passenger, with the loaner, she insisted on putting her Baby Brita in the far too shallow cup holder with the result it was constantly bouncing out. Again I would not expect this to be as big of an issue with the Revolution's smooth ride but a 2 year-old putting a cup or bottle into a tray slot repeatedly is bound to result in lots of drops to the ground.  Also the snack tray on my borrowed jogging stroller was in the way when loading and unloading my little honey.  The Revolution is wide open with no parts crossing in front of my precious cargo for her to become entangled in or hit in a sudden stop.  The superiorly designed 5 point harness keeps my adventure buddy securely in the seat without the dangers a solid object in front of her could pose.In addition to the sold separately handlebar console and snack tray, BOB offers several other accessories.  If you live in a cold climate as we currently do, a \"Warm Fuzzy,\" padded fleece seat liner that inserts into any BOB Stroller may be a worthwhile investment.  A \"Weather Shield,\" water resistant cover that helps to protect your child from head to toe from rain and wind while still allowing a view of the world is a highly recommended addition if you are where it may rain, be cold, windy, or snowing.  In warm weather, I recommend the \"Sun Shield,\" a mesh screen that reduces the sun's harmful ultraviolet UVA/UVB rays and helps provide a barrier to wind and flying insects.  Like the \"weather Shield\", the \"Sun Shield\", provides head to toe coverage.  Finally, as I mentioned earlier, the low boy cargo basket under the stroller that comes standard, is adequate for a modest diaper bag and other essentials.  If you, like I, prefer to walk to run errands rather than take a car, that cargo space is better left to small grocery orders and other things picked up along \"the trail.\"  A BOB Diaper Bag that clips directly to all BOB single and Duallie strollers or can be hung over the shoulder with the strap is an excellent addition to the accessories.  The BOB Diaper Bag is available through Amazon.com and other sellers.  The bag includes a changing pad and removable waterproof insert for handling those messes on the move without tying up the precious low boy cargo basket space.During the weeks Delaney and I have been testing the BOB Revolution SE, we were \"blessed\" with some wild weather including several storms of over 6 inches of snow, some very slick conditions, some serious slush and some intense wind.  I will confess I pushed this gem of a chariot hard.  Despite my best efforts to destabilize the Revolution SE I found it impossible to tip it over.  While I would not advise using the stroller as a \"walker\" for support, even with just my under 35 lb. granddaughter and no other cargo to provide extra weight, the stroller's low center of gravity kept it from tipping or flipping no matter how hard I pushed down on the push bar, the number or size of the pot holes riddling the sidewalks, or as much as 8 inches of snow and slush in our path.  The large wheels and air filled tires kept things moving straight and easy.The final endorsement of the BOB Revolution comes from Delaney.  She is now in the habit of screaming at mom and dad first thing in the morning to take her to \"Mambies.\"  Upon arrival she makes a beeline for the Revolution with demands to go for a buggie ride.  She would rather hit the trail for a 4 mile adventure than do anything else.Since we began our test, I have learned there will be two more grandchildren joining the 5 grandchildren ages 16 down to under a year.  The youngest will have a younger sibling right around her first birthday making a BOB Duallie a very likely addition to that household.  With the great review of the Revolution, it is very likely that another Revolution will be finding its way into the household of another son whose partner is expecting their first July 19, 2013.  For many years to come, I expect Mambie will be running along sidewalks, beaches, and trails from Maine to Florida pushing a BOB Revolution SE entrusted with her most precious cargo.\n",

      "1.0 ******************** WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT******************************************* WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT***********************Words cannot even begin to explain the hell I am in thanks to the purchase if this horribly made, incredibly dangerous product! My 3 month old son was thrown out of this swing while still strapped in and was found dangling by his right leg by my husband while I was attending a wedding in Japan. My son was taken to the emergency room where he was found to have a spiral fracture to his leg and bruising to the top of his head from the fall. He also had abrasion to his skin from what i would imagine him dangling and being dragged back and forth across our hard wood floors while still strapped in. If that wasnt horrible enough my husband was thrown in jail and charged with felony child abuse and all three of my children were taken into DHS custody where they have been in foster care for the past 6 months. I would normally NEVER attach my e-mail to something read by the public, however I cannot consciously experience this hell without urging anyone and everyone to not only stay away from this swing, but to recognize something must be done to make Fisher Price aware of the dangers of this swing. This swing MUST be pulled off the market. When I called Fisher Price they said they did not have enough complaints to pull this product. If anyone has had an injury to their child due to this product please e-mail me at cloud9respect@yahoo.com\n",

      "1.0 Health officials are warning parents not to use a special device designed to help keep babies in certain positions as they sleep. The device, called a sleep positioner, has been linked to at least 13 deaths in the last 15 years, officials with two federal agencies said on Wednesday.\"We urge parents and caregivers to take our warning seriously and stop using these sleep positioners,\" Inez Tenenbaum, the chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said in a statement.The sleep positioner devices come primarily in two forms. One is a flat mat with soft bolsters on each side. The other, known as a wedge-style positioner, looks very similar but has an incline, keeping a child in a very slight upright position.Makers of the devices claim that by keeping infants in a specific position as they sleep, they can prevent several conditions, including acid reflux and flat head syndrome, a deformation caused by pressure on one part of the skull. Many are also marketed to parents as a way to help reduce a child's risk of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, which kills thousands of babies every year, most between the ages of 2 months and 4 months.But the devices have never been shown in studies to prevent SIDS, and they may actually raise the likelihood of sudden infant death, officials say. One of the leading risk factors for sudden infant death is placing a baby on his or her stomach at bedtime, and health officials have routinely warned parents to lay babies on their backs. They even initiated a \"Back to Sleep\" campaign in the 1990s, which led to a sharp reduction in sudden infant deaths.With the positioner devices, if an infant rolls onto the stomach, the child's mouth and nose can press up against a bolster or some other part of the device, leading to suffocation. Even if placed on the back, a child can move up or down in the positioner, \"entrapping its face against a bolster or becoming trapped between the positioner and the crib side,\" Gail Gantt, a nurse consultant with the Food and Drug Administration, said in an e-mail. Or the child might scoot down the wedge in a way that causes the child's mouth and nose to press into the device.\"The baby's movement may also cause the positioner to flip on top of the baby, trapping the baby underneath the positioner or between the positioner and the side of the crib,\" she said.Of the 13 babies known to have suffocated in a sleep positioner since 1997, most died after they rolled from their sides onto their stomachs. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has also received dozens of reports of babies who were placed on their sides or backs, \"only to be found later in hazardous positions within or next to the product,\" the F.D.A. said in a statement.Many baby books for new parents specifically urge against using sleep positioners, and the American Academy of Pediatrics does not support their use for SIDS prevention. Though the F.D.A. has never approved the positioners for the prevention of SIDS, it has in the past approved a number of the devices for the prevention of gastroesophageal reflux disease and flat head syndrome. But the agency said that in light of the new safety data, it believed any benefits from using the devices were outweighed by the risk of suffocation.As of Wednesday, the agency is explicitly advising parents to stop using sleep positioners, and it has asked manufacturers of the devices to submit clinical data showing that the benefits of their products outweigh the risk of serious harm. In addition to avoiding the devices, experts say, parents should keep things like pillows, comforters, quilts and bumpers away from their infants and their cribs. Soft bedding can increase the likelihood of a baby suffocating.\"The safest crib is a bare crib,\" Dr. Susan Cummins, a pediatric expect with the F.D.A., said in a statement. \"Always put your baby on his or her back to sleep. An easy way to remember this is to follow the ABC's of safe sleep - Alone on the Back in a bare Crib.\"\n",

      "1.0 Edited to Add 6/4/2010:  Just wanted to add that Peg Perego gave me a full refund and sent a box and a pre-paid Fed Ex label for me to ship the high chair back.  The customer service was excellent.Edited To Add 5/2/2010:  SAFETY WARNING!  The last of the screws fell out. So the bottom side of the tray that separates the baby's legs is completely off.Edited To Add 5/1/2010: SAFETY WARNING!  Unbelievable.  Another screw fell out on the bottom side of the tray.  This is the third screw to fall out.  Fortunately, I saw it fall before the baby had a chance to swallow it.  I contacted Peg Perego on 4/28/2010 after the second screw fell out and demanded a refund.  To their credit, they said they would give us a refund once we show proof of purchase so we now have to find the receipt.  Also, they did add that they've never had this issue before on the Tatamia (which is relatively a new line) or on any of their Peg Perego high chairs.  I am wondering whether the screw mechanism on the bottom side of the tray are the same for all Peg Perego high chairs. I am wondering whether it is a design defect or a manufacturing defect.  Something is wrong.  Even IF my baby (from when he was 8 months - 12 months) was playing with it, it is a problem because a baby should NOT be able to unscrew sharp screws from the high chair so easily.Edited To Add on 4/28/2010:  SAFETY WARNING!  The screws underneath the tray falls out.  About a month ago, I was lifting our son out of the Tatamia chair when I saw a screw on my son's lap (almost an inch long with a sharp end).  I realized that it fell off from the bottom of the tray where there are 3 screws.  It scared me because he is at the stage where he puts everything in his mouth.  I was relieved he didn't swallow it and it didn't puncture him.  I had my husband put the screw back in.  Today, my husband was lifting our son out of the chair when he saw another screw on his lap.  We're sure our son is not unscrewing the screw (he is only 11 months old and not dextrous enough. Even so, the design should be such that a child cannot unscrew the screws.) This is unacceptable.  A baby can die if he swallows these screws.  I am downgrading this from 2 stars to 1 star.  I am going to call Peg Perego tomorrow.My husband and I were initially excited to get the Tatamia.  We've been using it for the past 6 months now and we're less than thrilled.  There are several problems with the Tatamia.  (1) The top tray falls off very easily.  Several times, my baby (at 10 months old) managed to get the top tray off... so that left a real mess. I tried to \"click\" in the top tray but it won't click in.  It just rests on the bottom tray.  Since the baby always flips it over, I just use the bottom tray now.  (2) It is difficult to slide the tray in and out of the high chair.  With both your index fingers, you have to position the knob just right to slide it in and out but the right side keeps getting stuck.  (3) My baby first hated sitting in it.  He has now grown accustomed to it but it doesn't look very comfortable.  (4) The plastic device on the back of the seat to enable you to recline or sit-up doesn't work very well.  I thought maybe it was just me until my husband started complaining about the same problem.  (5) The high chair doesn't roll very well.  You can't move the chair sideways so you have to go backwards and then swivel and then go forward. As for the swinging feature, we used it once and it was a pain to get it into that position and back so we never used it since.\n",

      "1.0 I personally didn't buy this gate, specifically because of the alarming number of reviews I found online about plastic shards breaking off of it. The following are only two of MANY reviews I found:\"Buyer Beware. We had two different gates sent to us. The initial one was missing a part. The second one had little pieces that were falling off of it the size of a piece of rice and sharper then you can imagine. We found this out because our nine month old was gagging on a piece - then investigated and found two other pieces on the floor. We took the part we needed out of the new gate and put it in the first one we received. We looked, and though that one looked okay. Last night I found two pieces that had broken off on the floor, thankfully before my son did. This happened to us twice - not a coincidence. I have talked to guest relations and they are putting out a product recall. This could have been a FATAL situation with our son!\"\"DO NOT BUY THIS! I CAN'T BELIEVE I ORDERED THIS! Even after seeing one review that said they found dangerous shards of the product on the floor, their child had choked on these pieces. I just recieved the product and looked it over, it looked fine, set it up and put my 7 month old in it. He cried a bit so I climbed in...that is when I found some small rice sized VERY SHARP! pieces of the gate that had fallen off from it . I can't figure out where they came from. I assumed the other review must be a fluke or that the problem was fixed as they said the company was suposed to put a recall. I called the company to complain and they said they had never heard of the problem, and only offered to send a replacement gate. If a small child swallowed one of these incredibly sharp pieces it has the potential to be fatal!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!\"In short, the product should probably be recalled. Do not put your children at risk!!\n",

      "1.0 Hello - we have had this stroller for a few months.  this morning my daughter's fingers was caught in the stroller and it is very dangerous.  I can see how this item can be a risk to children's fingers similar to the MaClaren stroller incident which caused massive recall of Maclaren strollers.  Here is an excerpt of what happened with similar MacClaren issues:\"(CNN) -- Close to one million strollers have been recalled by their manufacturer following reports at least 12 babies or toddlers had their fingers amputated after they were caught in the hinges.British company Maclaren said the recall concerns Chinese-made models on sale in the U.S. that open with an \"umbrella\" mechanism.The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said customers should stop using the strollers immediately.Maclaren said it was issuing a free repair kit make the hinges safe.The CPSC said the warning concerned models dating back to 1999 sold at stores including Target and Babies R Us.The mechanism \"poses a fingertip amputation and laceration hazard to the child when the consumer is unfolding,\" the CPSC said in statement issued jointly with Maclaren. \"\n",

      "1.0 WARNING to all owners newer model Peg Perego SIP 30/30 Infant Seats. It has two major defects.1> Defective part causes cuts on baby's heels and legs.2> Defective latch can cause seat to fall out of Pliko P3 stroller and have baby land on ground.Peg Perego's SIP 30/30 Infant seat is defective and they have not made registered customers aware of it.  They are not taking responsibility for the safety of the children using this seat.  They have been aware of the first issue since the beginning of summer 2008.The first issue with the seat causes cuts. We discovered lacerations on our son's ankles for over a month but could not figure out what was causing them. On a road trip we discovered a large bleeding gash on the back of his ankle about  the size of a DIME. We traced the source to the SIP 30/30 car seat's plastic strap cover near the feet. There was blood on the cover and the edges were sharp enough to cut my finger.  When I called Peg Perego, it took over an hour to get through to their customer service. Once I did, I discovered over 50 children have already been injured and they anticipate FOUR THOUSAND seats could have this issue. DO NOT follow their instructions to remove the plastic cover until receiving the replacement. The metal latch further cut up the back of our son's legs while waiting for the part. It took almost 4 DAYS to get the part from them instead of shipping it priority overnight.It is Peg Perego's RESPONSIBILITY to inform registered seat users of this dangerous issue, yet they have done NOTHING to warn people. Not even an e-mail. They plan to ship the parts when they have replacement. It has been almost 5 months since they first learned about the issue. How many more children will be injured before they make the public aware of this defect. Since discovering this issue, I have told every parent I see with this car seat about this issue. Their response is normally \"I was wondering where those cuts where coming from.\"The second issue with the seat is latching into Peg Perego's Pliko P3 stroller.  The infant seat has two possible latch points. We attached the seat to the stroller using the outside latch. We heard both sides of the seat \"click\" as explained. While pushing the cart the infant seat fell off the stroller and landed on the sidewalk with our son head down and screaming. We were lucky the stroller wasn't stopped by a street where it could have fallen in front of a car. The fact it can even latch to something that will not hold the seat, much less EASILY latch,  is a SERIOUS design defect that is extremely dangerous to children. It could be fatal.Peg Perego needs to take responsibility for their poorly designed products and let people know about these issues. Hopefully as a buyer you will review this and evaluate if their products are safe for your children before buying and they are injured.If I could give this product less than 1 star, I would.\n",

      "1.0 A Personal Warning to all who have this baby toy by Lamaze. (Stretch The Giraffe)PLEASE READ!!I LOVED this giraffe..this thing is the cutest toy ever and I had placed this on my wish list for my baby shower last May. Well..I ended up receiving the giraffe from a good friend of mine for my baby shower like I had wanted. My son had only played with it maybe twice since he's been born, so it's still pretty brand new.My son is 10 months old now, and we just moved to a new house last week, so I re introduced him to stretch yesterday, (still in super new condition) and he had been sitting in his highchair playing with him, chewing and biting on him as most babies will do with their toys. It's to be expected.I was upstairs unpacking, my son was in his highchair next to my husband while he washed dishes when my son started choking!!He was choking on the white stuffing inside the toys foot! He had managed to chew the thing until it became unstitched at the seams and that's when the stuffing began to fill his mouth. He must have swallowed a majority of what he had in his mouth. Needless to say, it was a frightening moment for all of us!!UGH! I am just so disappointed and now concerned for anyone else's children who may have this toy!Upon close inspection of this toy after the fact, I noticed that the stitching is very poor. Not nearly strong enough to withstand the mouth of a teething baby! I noted other parts of the giraffes seams and stitching where it has signs of also beginning to become unstitched!The very worst part is the fact that had my son gone un noticed and not attended to right away, he could have very well choked completely, or the round small plastic squeaker (also inside the same foot he opened) could have also come out and easily become lodged inside his throat! In fact there are multiple \"perfectly sized pieces\" including a small round ball rattle, a more flat circular shaped rattle and the disc shaped squeaker (the one my son almost managed to get out) inside each foot. Again..they are very poorly secured inside the giraffe and are a major choking hazard! I hate to think of how many babies go to bed with this toy and are possibly left alone with it when they wake up in the morning or after a nap. Parent unsuspecting, because these toys made by learning curve are supposed to be designed with safety in mind. Safety being what Learning Curves number one priority is.  I would have never have thought to check those details since I was convinced this toy or any toy designed by a big name baby toy company was undoubtedly safe to let my baby play with.This toy needs to be recalled ASAP! I have contacted Learning Curve /Lamaze RC2 department regarding this serious issue, and Stretch the Giraffe is on his way back to them for inspection. I have no doubt they will issue a recall. If I were you...and just to warn parents ahead of time..please refrain from buying stretch for now! Or if you have him already, take him away from your baby...especially babies with teeth!In an effort to make me, the consumer happy, they offered me a new toy and that's on it's way now, but in reality, is that really enough? Or does that make up for the fact that we watched our little son choke and go through that trauma? Imagining the scenario if we had not been right there to help him...would the new toy suffice? It's horrifying imagining the things that COULD have happened and Thank God that didn't.In addition I am going to be weary of the new toy and I am not even sure he will play with it until I inspect every inch of it, and now I need to sit with him every second while he plays with in fear that some little thing could go wrong in a toy that has been deemed safe from a reputable company I have grown to love and trust. I just believe this is an honest mistake but a serious issue that was grossly overlooked. I know that Learning Curve will do the right thing in the end.I will never send my son to bed nor leave him to play with ANY toy, stuffed animal, or object ever again for fear that he will wake up, be alone and begin innocently teething while I am still asleep, and something similar to this may happen. It's a good thing that wasn't the case this time.Please parents...check the babies toys! You just never know!!Forward this to all your friends who you think may have this toy, may buy it, are expecting a baby, have infants and small children.-Tiffany\n",

      "1.0 We were given the LuLy LadyBug Rocker (same company, different design) when my daughter was in utero. It shipped to our house and remained in its original box until we opened it. When we opened it, our daughter was the recommended age of 10 months. We put her on it and, with a parent guiding her gently, with one hand on her back and the other holding her hand and the handlebar, we proceeded to let her rock gently.Immediately, the front chest area of the ladybug \"fell\" forward as if it had come off a stand or something inside the body of the ladybug. The rocker went forward way too much and our daughter was jutted forward. Had it not been for the parent right next to her, I believe she would have flipped headfirst over the rocker. We attempted to use it again and the same thing happened. We put the rocker aside.Having repeatedly attempted to help her enjoy the rocker safely in the past year, it now sits in her room, with the tag on, and she uses the musical buttons and that's it.What a waste. Today we once again attempted to let her use the rocker in a final attempt to enjoy it, and despite a parent sitting right next to her, my daughter rocked gently twice and flipped headfirst over the handle. She hit her chin on the handle, splitting her chin open and the rocker fell over on her.With our experience, and having searched many websites selling this product and hundreds of reviews, it is now unequivocally my opinion that this product is unsafe. I've filed a report with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I have contacted the company requesting a statement with regards to their plan to recall or issue a product alert.You should file a report with the CPSC about this. I have. My daughter was injured rocking normally with parental supervision. The more of us who say something, the better.Someone else filed a review as well.  [...]\n",

      "1.0 My 6 month old daughter was fastened to the Fisher Price G2609 Nature's Touch cradle swing. She has been using it since she was born. The straps were secure and the belts fastened. She begain to reach for the little toys that rotate above the seat and wouldsit back down. She repeated the motions for about 10 minutes. She then reached again and then fell down over the side and landed on her shoulder and head  while her leg was caught on the fastened seatbelts. The problem appeared to be the way the seat belts are secured to the plastic seat. There is a sall slit where you stick in the end of the seat bellt and a fold at the end of the seat belt opens up and is suppose to not come out of the slit unless you fold it in a certain way and pull on it. This seemed to happen by chance and I deem it a very poor and unsafe design to secure a seat belt to an infant seat. My baby suffered tons of scratches and shoulder and head injuries but nothing serious but I believe tihs is a very dangerous product that utilizes a very dangerous mechanism to secure seat belts.\n",

However, yesterday my husband called me and said, \"she got that purple thing off and had it in her mouth.\"  Of course I contacted baby einstine as the toy hook is a very small piece and is a choking hazard.  They put me in touch with Kids II Corporation.  I told the woman what happened, she said it was a mis-mold on the piece and she knows that because they have been getting a LOT of calls about this piece coming off.  She asked if I wanted a replacement part.  Of course I said NO!!!  She asked why I was calling if I didn't want a replacement part.  I explained to her that it was a choking hazard and they needed to do something about it as a child could die from the defective piece.  She then stopped me and said the toy hook was NOT defective, it was just mis-molded.  (Ummm...isn't that defective?) And she also informed me it wasn't a choking hazard, there was the possibility that a child could get it lodged in his/her throat, but it isn't a choking hazard.  (Ummm...isn't choking on a toy usually done when it gets lodged in their throat?)  She then informed me that she was not going to write a report up since I didn't want a replacement piece (can you say covering something up!).  I requested her name and extention.  She said there was no way to contact specifically her.  I requested a copy of our phone conversation as she said it was being recorded.  She said there was no way to get a copy of it.

      "1.0 I have a 12 mos old daughter and purchased this gate about 6 weeks ago.  Today she reached through the narrow areas on the outside of the swinging door area of the gate.  She reached past her elbow, and then bent her arm, thus making the width of her arm increase.  She tried to pull her arm out but could not.  She then pulled harder and wedged the flesh of her arm in the narrow space between two bars.  She started screaming, which is when I saw what she did (I was folding clothes).  I immediately ran over and tried to pull her arm out without realizing exactly how it was stuck, causing her even more pain and to cry even harder.  It took me a few mins with her in pain and screaming to figure out it was stuck because it was bent and wedged in there.  I straightened her arm and was able to extract it.  Just as crib rails now have a spacing requirement to prevent this very issue, it shouldn't take a rocket scientist for a manufacturer of a SAFETY product to consider that a toddler might be interested in what's on the other side of the gate and try to reach through.  As a first-time parent, I embarrassingly admit I did not notice that narrow spacing and imagine what would/could happen, but a company with the majority of its business based in the SAFETY of babies and children has no excuse.  As we all find in the parenting journey, I have learned this lesson the hard way and will be sure not to allow such a dangerous product into my home again.  The reason I purchased this gate was because it was one of the few that expanded as widely as I needed.  However, that is nowhere near as important as protecting my baby from needless injury like this.  I shudder to think how this might have gone if I had been in the shower or restroom and unable to immediately respond, all the while thinking everything was ok because I have a safety gate installed to prevent her from getting to dangerous areas.  I have already reported this to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and will follow this review with a report to Summer Infant itself.  DO NOT RISK YOUR CHILD'S SAFETY WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!I have included (in the \"add your own images\" are of the product at the top of this page) a picture of my daughter's arm immediately following the incident.  I am sure it will become a nasty bruise in a day or two.  We'll see if this site allows this image to be included.UPDATE:  Summer Infant has reached out and sent a free shipping label to return the product.  They will be sending it to quality control so they can investigate the safety concerns.  They will follow up with me.  I am pleased with their prompt response and attempt to investigate.  They have a mesh gate that is similar in width which I will try in exchange.\n"
